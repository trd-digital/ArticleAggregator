        "subhead": "The mayor\u2019s enthusiasm for the White Stadium project stands in sharp contrast to seven years ago, when she blocked a plan for a New England Revolution stadium as a city councilor",
        "content": "It wasn\u2019t that long ago that one of the most powerful members of the Boston City Council raised all sorts of questions about whether the city was moving too quickly to sell city land to a private developer for a professional soccer stadium.The councilor? Michelle Wu, who in 2018 stood in the way of then-Mayor Marty Walsh\u2019s plan to help Robert Kraft build a soccer stadium for his New England Revolution. Walsh wanted to issue a request for proposals, or an RFP, to sell an 18-acre city-owned tow lot in South Boston off the Southeast Expressway, as a way to give Kraft an opportunity at a site for a long-planned Revs stadium.But Walsh had to get his plan past Wu, who at the time chaired a council committee that had to declare the lot surplus property before it could be sold. And she wasn\u2019t going to just greenlight it.\u201cRather than just take a vote and move on, we should hear more from the public and gather more [information],\u201d Wu told the Globe at the time. \u201cPublic land should be used for the greatest public good. We haven\u2019t seen any analysis yet of what the greatest good would be.\u201dAdvertisementMy my, how the tables have turned.The lot never went up for sale \u2014 it\u2019s still where you go when your car gets towed from downtown \u2014 and Kraft moved on, setting his sights on building a stadium in Everett. But the more things change, the more they stay the same.Wu\u2019s now the mayor, trying to help a new professional women\u2019s soccer team turn White Stadium in Franklin Park into a gleaming new home. And now she, too, is getting in hot water over the city\u2019s RFP process.The White Stadium arrangement is different than the tow lot in that Wu is not selling the 10,000-seat facility to a private developer, but rather leasing it to Boston Unity Soccer Partners for 10 years. Under the deal, the city would continue to own the stadium, and the team would share it with Boston Public Schools. The city and team will split the cost of the renovation, which is expected to exceed $200 million.AdvertisementThe city tow lot south of downtown was once seen as a potential site for a stadium for the New England Revolution. But then-City Councilor Michelle Wu blocked a deal.David L. RyanWhite Stadium has been crumbling for decades, and many a mayor has tried to renovate it. The Wu administration contends that having a private partner is the only way the city can afford to fix it, and the deal struck with the team still gives the community and BPS full-day access to the stadium for all but 40 days of the year.But much as Wu did seven years ago, critics say the White Stadium plan is opaque, misguided, and being rammed through. The city, they say, needs to do more research on how best to renovate the stadium for BPS.This week we learned, as first reported in the Boston Herald, that Wu\u2019s City Hall has been in talks with Boston Unity Soccer Partners about White Stadium as early as September 2022. With the seed planted, the city issued an RFP in April 2023 for a lease of White Stadium in a \u201cpublic-private partnership.\u201dWe can all guess what happened next: The RFP went out, and Boston Unity Soccer Partners was the only group that submitted a proposal.Opponents of the White Stadium plan \u2014 some neighbors and the Emerald Necklace Conservancy \u2014 have seized on the Herald story, based on email exchanges between the team and city officials, as proof the team had an inside track on the stadium.Mayoral challenger Josh Kraft had choice words, too, calling the report evidence of a \u201csecretive and rigged RFP process.\u201dWu has vigorously disputed that characterization, calling it \u201cinaccurate.\u201d Indeed, there\u2019s nothing untoward about potential bidders having conversations with the city before an RFP is filed, and it\u2019s conceivable that the RFP generated only a single response.Advertisement(Linda Henry, chief executive of Boston Globe Media Partners, has had a minority interest in the women\u2019s soccer team, and last week she announced she is pulling out of the team\u2019s investor group.)As for what happened in 2018, Wu got on the phone on Thursday to say that she has been \u201ccompletely consistent\u201d on how there should be public discussions about how to use public land. She said the Walsh administration\u2019s proposal to sell the tow lot for a soccer stadium never went anywhere because no one was willing to publicly offer details at a hearing Wu chaired at the time.\u201cI was never opposed to a soccer stadium in Boston,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt that we should try to bring that amenity and economic development opportunity and excitement to the city.\u201dWu went on to say that after becoming mayor she reached out to Robert Kraft about having the Revs stadium in Boston. She said she never heard back. (On Friday, a spokesperson for Robert Kraft said he never heard from the Wu administration.)The White Stadium deal reflects how she feels that public land should not be sold off, similar to how she felt as a councilor in 2018, and how public land as a general principle \u201cshould stay wherever possible, under the public trust, under public ownership, because that is how you have permanent control over what happens.\u201dStill, that hasn\u2019t placated opponents who have sued the city to halt the project, with the case set to go to trial on March 18. Demolition is well underway, and Wu said the construction schedule is on track. The women\u2019s team is planning to play in the renovated White Stadium by its inaugural season next spring.AdvertisementMeantime, it\u2019s a mayoral election year. Stadium opponents and supporters are worked up. And just as you thought the L\u2019Affaire White Stadium couldn\u2019t get any messier \u2014 it has.So, for Wu, perhaps we\u2019ll file this one under: Do as I say, not as I do.Shirley Leung is a Business columnist.

        "hed": "Middleborough sues Healey, state over MBTA housing law requirements",
        "subhead": "",
        "content": "The town of Middleborough sued Governor Maura Healey and the state housing office Friday, seeking an exemption from the controversial MBTA Communities Act, which requires cities and towns served by the T to make it easier to build multifamily housing within their borders.The lawsuit asks for a waiver from the law\u2019s zoning requirements under a recent opinion from State Auditor Diana DiZoglio, who called the law an \u201cunfunded mandate\u201d because, she said, the Legislature did not designate adequate funds for its implementation.Related: More controversy erupts after state auditor says Mass. housing law is an \u2018unfunded mandate\u2019Middleborough, the town said in the lawsuit, has already built housing near its commuter rail station in recent years, and should not be forced to make room for more. Adhering to the law\u2019s requirements would be a \u201csignificant expense\u201d because the town does not have the infrastructure to accommodate more development, it said. Lawyers for the town added that the state has gone too far in punishing towns it deems noncompliant, carrying out a \u201ccampaign of threats, intimidation, and coercion.\u201dMiddleborough, a town of 24,000 about 30 miles south of Boston, has been at odds with the state over MBTA Communities for years. Its Select Board in 2022 voted to ignore the law\u2019s requirements, making it the first town to take an official stand against the law. Last year, Town Meeting there overwhelmingly voted down a plan to comply, and the Select Board again decided this year against submitting an action plan for compliance under an extended state deadline.AdvertisementThe town wrote to DiZoglio\u2019s office last year requesting her to weigh in on the law, and when Middleborough officials received her opinion last week calling it an unfunded mandate, they moved quickly to prepare a lawsuit.For the Healey administration, this is yet another roadblock for a law that it inherited from the Legislature but has become central to its housing strategy.The administration set a goal in February of building 222,000 new homes by 2035 in order to head off the housing shortage, which is quickly warping the economic reality of everyday residents. The state is well behind the pace of construction needed to meet that goal, and officials see MBTA Communities \u2014 Massachusetts\u2019 most consequential new housing law in decades \u2014 as key to course correcting. Most of the state\u2019s housing production over the last several decades has happened in Boston and a few neighboring communities. The law is designed to stimulate housing production in the suburbs and towns in Eastern Massachusetts that have long shut out new development.Related: 222,000 new homes must be built over the next decade to fix housing shortage, state saysAdvertisementBut towns have not taken kindly to the law. Some see it as an affront on Massachusetts' tradition of local government decisions over land-use rules, and many do not want to encourage the production of more homes, particularly apartment buildings.The law requires 177 cities and towns with access to the T create zoning districts that allow for multifamily housing, but it does not mandate building.Attorney General Andrea Campbell sued the town of Milton last year for failing to meet the law\u2019s requirements, and the Supreme Judicial Court upheld the law, though it also ruled that the state must put the guidelines that shape its implementation through a formal regulatory process.Campbell, in a statement Friday, said her office will defend the law.\u201cI am grateful to the majority of communities that understand the importance of responsible zoning, and my office and I intend to successfully defend this law in court,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cIt is regrettable that the Auditor\u2019s incorrect legal assessment has spurred challenges to a law meant to address our housing crisis.\u201dMiddleborough officials say the town created a multifamily zoning district in 2021 that has since yielded 174 multifamily units, a quarter of which are set at affordable rents. And over the last 20 years, the town has seen 881 housing units built within a mile of its commuter rail station.Related: How will the state\u2019s historic rezoning mandate affect your community?AdvertisementIt argues that should be enough to satisfy the requirements of MBTA Communities. But under the law, the town has to create zoning that makes room for at least 1,471 units. The zoning the town passed in 2021 only allows for 549 units.Lawyers for the town said it has been unfairly punished for not complying with the law\u2019s requirements \u201cthrough the withholding and/or recission of more than $6.5 million in funding for school programs, infrastructure projects, and other initiatives that are necessary to provide the very housing the Act was enacted to create.\u201d Those funding programs are discretionary, and the state has, in some cases, tied towns\u2019 chances of approval to their MBTA Communities compliance status.\u201cThis isn\u2019t something new in Middleboro. We recognize the need for more housing near public transit as a function of responsible town planning,\u201d Middleborough Town Manager James McGrail said Friday. \u201cWe\u2019ve done our part. We are not anti-housing. The fact that we\u2019re even having to go to court to sort this out is crazy.\u201dAndrew Brinker can be reached at andrew.brinker@globe.com. Follow him @andrewnbrinker.",

        "content": "A team of Boston developers and Chicago investors have unveiled their designs for a pair of 18-story apartment towers on the site of the former WLVI television studio in Dorchester, the first phase of an already approved project that would bring five other buildings to that stretch of Morrissey Boulevard.Local development firm Copper Mill and an entity managed by Chicago-based investor POB Capital are proposing two towers with a combined 754 apartments near the JFK/UMass MBTA stop, next to the former headquarters of The Boston Globe, now a lab and office complex called Southline.The development team \u201cis committed to delivering a mixed-use program that serves the long-term interests of Savin Hill, Columbia Point and greater Dorchester neighborhoods,\u201d wrote Andrew Flynn, Copper Mill\u2019s founder and chief executive, in a December letter to the Boston Planning Department.AdvertisementA rendering of two 18-story residential towers proposed at 75 Morrissey Blvd. in Dorchester.CBTDesigned by Boston-based CBT Architects, the towers \u2014 one at 204 feet facing Morrissey Boulevard, another at 206 feet facing Interstate 93 \u2014 would each have three levels of underground parking. Between them, the developers have planned a roughly half-acre community park.The Morrissey Boulevard project stretches nearly 9 acres from 35-75 Morrissey Blvd., including the Star Market grocery store and former TV studio along with the former Beasley Media radio studios. A seven-building master plan, approved by the Boston Planning and Development Agency board in 2023 \u2014 albeit under a different developer \u2014 calls for three apartment buildings and four office/lab buildings.The BPDA board-approved master plan calls for a grocery store to be included within the third planned residential tower. The radio site at 55 Morrissey Blvd. now houses The Record Co., which offers affordable recording studio and rehearsal spaces.

        "content": "Massachusetts state officials have offered up a prime location in Woburn for development: the 26-acre Anderson Regional Transportation Center.The transportation hub, at 100 Atlantic Ave., is owned by a joint venture of the Massachusetts Port Authority, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, and is home to a station for the MBTA\u2019s Lowell commuter rail line, Amtrak\u2019s Downeaster line, and Massport\u2019s Logan Express shuttles. Any development would need to retain or enhance the various transit uses. However, because of a history of pollution there, residential and school uses are currently not allowed.The goal is to find a developer willing to take some or all of the 2,400 surface parking spaces and consolidate them in a multi-level garage, opening up land for development. For now, the transit agencies are seeking \u201cexpressions of interest\u201d from developers to better understand the site\u2019s potential and the market demand. Responses are due by April 30.Other development activities nearby include the rezoning of 53 acres east of the rail line, to allow for multifamily construction in compliance with the MBTA Communities Act, the start of construction of a 425-unit multifamily project northwest of the transit hub, and permits issued for a 250-unit multifamily project north of the hub and a mixed-use project just to the west of it.AdvertisementOne of the biggest challenges, though, will be dealing with the property\u2019s contamination and its legacy as a Superfund site (a federal designation that identifies highly polluted properties). Industrial operations at the property, part of what was once known as the Industri-Plex site, contaminated the nearby Aberjona River as well as adjacent wetlands and the Mystic Lakes over the course of more than a century, through the 1960s. The transit agencies, in developing the Anderson center more than 20 years ago, built 25 acres of parking and a subsurface \u201cgeotextile\u201d barrier to help contain the underground pollution.For a developer to proceed with residential construction, the transit agencies said, it would need to work with federal and state environmental regulators to reevaluate the residential restriction.The transit hub is named after Jimmy Anderson, a child who died at the age of 12 from leukemia and whose case was made famous in the book and the movie, \u201cA Civil Action,\u201d about groundwater pollution in Woburn.AdvertisementJon Chesto can be reached at jon.chesto@globe.com.

He dealt with learning disabilities and lingering effects of malnutrition from his earliest years, then went on to run track in high school and graduate from North Shore Community College.Montanino struggled with alcoholism in his college years \u2014 a problem that led him to living on the streets for nearly two years. He\u2019d bounce back and forth from the Constitution Beach Walk to Jeffries Point, to the library and the flower shop. Sometimes he did food app delivery on foot for $7 an order.\u201cThat was my homeless life, just going from one thing to another ... never really knowing where my next meal was coming from,\u201d he said.AdvertisementThese days, though, Montanino is calling Jamaica Plain home. He\u2019s one of the new residents at 3368 Washington St., a five-story, $105 million residential building celebrating its grand opening on Wednesday. Developed by Boston-based The Community Builders and homeless services provider Pine Street Inn, the building \u2014 to be named \u201cThe Lyndia\u201d in honor of Pine Street Inn executive director Lyndia Downie \u2014 is the largest permanent supportive housing development in New England. The 202-unit building includes 140 studios for formerly unhoused people referred by Pine Street in one wing, and 62 affordable units for families in another.The city of Boston provided some $17.3 million to the project, and supported it amid a lengthy lawsuit that challenged its zoning.Related: \u2018Permanent supportive housing\u2019 may be controversial to would-be neighbors, but it\u2019s been beneficial to those who live in it | Shirley Leung\u201cTo solve homelessness, you have to tackle the roots of the problem, which is making sure that people can have a home, and have support in living in their homes,\u201d said Boston Mayor Michelle Wu. \u201cYou really have to have a plan for homes to be accessible and supportive for everyone.\u201dDownie has long championed permanent supportive housing, which is basically an apartment with social services on site, and Pine Street has gradually grown its inventory of such buildings in recent years. Advocates say tackling the roots of homelessness requires more than just handing out grants, and instead making sure individuals have both a roof over their heads and access to health and wellness support systems to guide them through a world-upending transition. Montanino said he is frequently connected with security and outreach personnel, case managers, a personal landlord, and property managers, all of whom helped him move \u2014 and stay \u2014 off the streets.Advertisement\u201cThey\u2019re all hands on deck here,\u201d he said.Michael Montanino in his new unit at 3368 Washington St.Jonathan Wiggs/Globe StaffThe 3368 Washington project includes support services like onsite mental health counseling, 24/7 security, and key fob-activated elevators. Residents are directly referred by Pine Street Inn. On a recent tour of the building, fliers for workforce development programs with Pine Street and Roxbury Community College were available for anyone to read.The property was formerly a low-slung warehouse, which Pine Street bought in 1997 and over the years used for a variety of functions, including office space for case workers and a small woodworking program. As Pine Street ramped up its housing development efforts, the site stood out, particularly given its proximity to the Green Street Orange Line station. Most developers responded to Pine Street\u2019s bid for proposals with pitches for around 40 to 60 units, Downie said. But Bart Mitchell, CEO of The Community Builders, aimed higher.\u201cBart and I went over to look at the site, and Bart, even that day, said, \u2018Look, if we can get some height relief, we can do something really sustainable here. We can get some scale,\u2019\u201d Downie said. \u201cThat was what, for us, was so exciting. ... The more long-term people you can move out, the better chance you have of meeting shelter demand.\u201dThe project hasn\u2019t been without its challenges. The landlord of a neighboring property sued in 2020, alleging the zoning process to allow the project was flawed. Though the lawsuit eventually settled, the delay cost \u201cmultiple millions\u201d of dollars, said Andy Waxman, Community Builders\u2019 senior vice president of real estate.AdvertisementPine Street and The Community Builders are collaborating on similar projects, including 900 Morrissey Blvd. in Dorchester, which is under construction now.

And so it takes people some time to learn that.\u201dPotential residents apply through the Boston Housing Authority, and then are screened by Pine Street. Folks have moved in gradually over the past few months, Downie said, and the building is expected to be full by June.With a gentle demeanor and a quick smile, Montanino proudly showed off his new home last week. He\u2019s learning to cook, and there are spices and oil next to his stove \u2014 he\u2019s done steaks and chicken, burgers, and salads. He\u2019s volunteering, and has lined up a job \u2014 he starts in April.

        "content": "When Fortis Property Group announced a $1 billion refinancing of One Lincoln St. in 2022, the developers championed the deal as a milestone for downtown Boston\u2019s revitalization.Fortis had landed a deal to lease 11 floors of the 36-story office building to private equity company HarbourVest and promised a heap of amenities \u2014 rooftop tennis and basketball courts, an artisanal market, and biergarten \u2014 to draw more tenants to fill the rest of the half-empty tower. Those plans attracted sophisticated investors, including San Francisco-based DivcoWest and Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC, according to a real estate industry source with knowledge of the deal.\u201cThis is an important moment for our firm and all of our partners,\u201d said Joel Kestenbaum, president of Brooklyn-based Fortis, at the time. \u201cAnd we couldn\u2019t be prouder to see this deal come to fruition after nearly a year in the making.\u201dNext week, the 503-foot tower will go up for auction \u2014 a move forced by one of Fortis\u2019s unpaid lenders.AdvertisementIt\u2019s a stunning turn of events for a building whose blue glass and gray granite facade has long been one of the most prominent points on Boston\u2019s skyline. For two decades, it was home to State Street Corp., until 2023, when the financial giant decamped for a new tower across town.One Lincoln never recovered, and today \u2014 despite HarbourVest\u2019s arrival \u2014 the building still stands about half empty. There are at least four big loans on the tower, and with little rent coming in, Fortis has struggled to pay down its substantial debt. Now lenders want the money back. In the auction process, a new owner will likely take over the building.The facade at One Lincoln St.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffFortis did not respond to a request for comment.While it\u2019s not clear how much One Lincoln will fetch at auction, it\u2019s fair to expect a far lower sum than the $1 billion valuation it commanded in 2022. That\u2019s a reality facing many commercial real estate owners in Boston right now. Five years after COVID upended the city\u2019s office market, a long-delayed reckoning on the value of office towers is coming, with major implications on the city\u2019s tax base and the future of downtown.Advertisement\u201cIt\u2019s like the stock market \u2014 it\u2019s not a loss until you sell it,\u201d said Dion Sorrentino, associate director of market analytics at CoStar Group in Boston. \u201cThey\u2019re going to hold it for as long as they can.\u201dFor a dozen years after the 2008 financial crisis, commercial real estate prices steadily rose in Boston, generating eye-popping sales numbers and fueling the city\u2019s budget. Rock-bottom interest rates made borrowing easy and cheap. Companies poured into downtown to tap the city\u2019s talented young workforce. By the end of 2019, office vacancy was in the single digits and investors spent more than $8 billion that year alone to snap up commercial real estate that, by all accounts, was going to remain valuable for years to come.Then came the pandemic. Demand for office space plummeted, and today the vacancy rate is 21.1 percent, according to real estate firm Newmark. Meanwhile interest rates skyrocketed. That made it more expensive to borrow money for development projects and to refinance existing debt, particularly loans made at low, pre-COVID, interest rates.A developer has proposed converting 400 Atlantic Ave., a low-lying brick office facing Boston Harbor, into a hotel.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffDowntown landlords could hang on, for a time.While there are abundant smaller owners, many premier buildings in Boston are owned \u2014 in full or in part \u2014 by large real estate firms such as Boston Properties and Tishman Speyer; private equity like Rockpoint Group; or investment arms of pension funds or sovereign wealth funds, such as Oxford Properties and Norges Bank. Their deep pockets bought them time, and lenders offered extensions on repayments for a year or two, said Mark Fallon, director of research and strategy at real estate brokerage Hunneman in Boston.AdvertisementFor years, that \u201cextend and pretend\u201d phenomenon kept Boston\u2019s commercial real estate sales market in relative stasis. Meanwhile owners fished for lucrative new leases to pay down their debt. The prospect of converting office to lab space \u2014 expensive, but with the potential to draw in high-paying life-science companies as tenants \u2014 continued to generate hope for a turnaround.But mostly, local owners have held off on selling for a simple reason, said Jeffrey Havsy of Moody\u2019s Analytics.\u201cThey didn\u2019t have to,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no forcing mechanism, if the debt wasn\u2019t due.\u201dNow though, those bills are coming due, prompting new momentum in the sales market. For many, the decision to sell will be difficult and costly: Havsy said many downtown buildings could sell for 40 to 60 percent of their pre-COVID price.The trend is one that city officials and financial watchdogs are monitoring closely. Some 71.1 percent of Boston\u2019s $4.6 billion budget is funded by property taxes \u2014 much of it on commercial property \u2014 and price declines could hit that revenue hard. But the change could also lower rents, potentially broadening the number of tenants who can afford space downtown.Related: Corporate signs are proliferating on Boston's skylineA price reset, Havsy said, can also loosen up opportunities for investors with cash and patience, like Norges Bank. In December, an arm of the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund paid $248 per square foot for just over half of 33 Arch St., according to research from real estate firm Avison Young. That\u2019s less than half the $606 per square foot that retirement behemoth TIAA paid to buy the 33-story downtown tower in 2011. (Norges bought out the first half of TIAA\u2019s stake in 2013.)Advertisement\u201cIn a period of heightened dislocation in the office sector, we see this as an opportune moment to invest,\u201d said Norges real estate executive Per L\u00f8ken in a statement. Along with offices in San Francisco and Washington, D.C., Norges also bought just over half of 501 Boylston St. in Back Bay \u2014 noting its $194.9 million in existing debt \u2014 giving it full control of the building after it bought the first half in 2018.TIAA did not respond to a Globe request for comment.That kind of real estate calculus \u2014 or perhaps musical chairs \u2014 can get tricky fast, leaving a fair amount of uncertainty as to what buildings are actually worth. In the past five years, it\u2019s been tough to discern the pandemic\u2019s impact on office values, and, in turn, municipal tax revenues \u2014 in large part because many owners haven\u2019t had to sell.\u201cWhat is happening now is a reset,\u201d said Jason S. Weissman, founder of Boston Realty Advisors. \u201cAnd we\u2019re seeing it all over.\u201dMany of the city\u2019s largest taxpayers are commercial landlords. One Lincoln, the tower up for auction in March, owes more than $15 million in net tax to the city this fiscal year. The 32-story office tower at 99 High St., which went up for sale in July, owes $8.6 million in net taxes. The value of those buildings has an outsize impact on city finances, one reason Mayor Michelle Wu last year sought to hike commercial tax rates to keep revenue flowing. That effort stalled in the state Senate, but she is trying again this year.The 32-story office tower at 99 High St. was listed for sale in July 2024.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffIndeed, a 40 percent to 60 percent decline in downtown property values could represent a mammoth hit to city finances. The Boston Municipal Research Bureau, an independent financial watchdog organization, in November explored how the city could diversify its revenue sources to not be so heavily dependent on property taxes.AdvertisementOf course, not all buildings are selling for a loss. An entity of Qatari investor Ezdan Holding Group paid $99.5 million for the 11-story office at 855 Boylston St. in Back Bay in fall 2023 \u2014 more than double what the property sold for in 2000. And, generally speaking, newer and higher-end buildings have maintained stronger demand from tenants willing to pay top-tier rents.But for buildings with low occupancy, it\u2019s difficult to restructure debt, said Aaron Jodka, the director of US capital markets research for Colliers. That\u2019s opening up avenues for buyers \u2014 family offices, sovereign wealth funds, and other private investors \u2014 who are seeing \u201ca generational acquisition opportunity,\u201d Jodka said, and sometimes a chance to try something other than office space.One example: JAJ Investment Group, the Luxembourg-based family office of French financier Jacques Chahine, plans to convert 400 Atlantic Ave. \u2014 a low-lying former law office facing Boston Harbor \u2014 into a hotel. The office was formerly the longtime home of Goulston & Storrs, which moved to nearby One Post Office Square last April.\u201cWhen there is upheaval and change in the market, it does create new opportunities for others,\u201d Jodka said. \u201cUnfortunately, there\u2019s usually the pain the previous owner has to go through.\u201dCatherine Carlock can be reached at catherine.carlock@globe.com.

        "content": "On the day he launched his mayoral campaign, Josh Kraft went on the offensive, assailing Mayor Michelle Wu over her record on bike lanes and housing construction. That was no surprise.But one avenue of attack raised eyebrows across the city. Kraft said he would make good on a progressive policy promise that Wu had tried but failed: Bringing rent control back to Boston.\u201cMayor Wu promised us rent control three years ago,\u201d Kraft said. \u201cWe will deliver it finally.\u201dThat Kraft, the son of billionaire Patriots owner Robert Kraft and a favored candidate in some corners of the business community, would lean into an issue that many economists believe does more harm than good and most landlords despise, signals just how big a problem the cost of housing has become for everyday Bostonians. Yet the specifics of his proposal suggest he\u2019s trying to walk a fine political line to appeal to two very different political constituencies that rarely see eye to eye: the business community and tenants.While Kraft calls his proposal rent control, housing experts and political observers said it is not really rent control in the traditional sense of the hard rent caps seen in New York City, San Francisco, and Boston before state voters outlawed them here in 1994. It is instead an optional program for landlords who would receive tax breaks if they agree to cap annual rent increases. While it could be appealing for property owners to participate, it is not mandatory. And critics argue Kraft\u2019s plan may simply provide some landlords with tax breaks, while doing little to protect struggling renters.Related: Josh Kraft\u2019s tax break for \u2018good landlords\u2019 already exists, and the Boston City Council just voted for itAdvertisementBut his embrace of a term once considered politically untenable appears to be a calculated move. The idea of rent control has become increasingly popular in some corners of the city as rents climb relentlessly upward. And these days, political observers say, winning an election in Boston requires a whatever-it-takes approach to housing affordability.\u201c[Kraft\u2019s proposal] is not rent control, but the fact that he\u2019s proposing it shows how significant an issue housing has become for the city,\u201d said Josh Zakim, a former city councilor who served alongside Wu and who now runs a housing advocacy group. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest issue facing the city and the Commonwealth, and I don\u2019t think you can run a serious campaign for public office here without a plan to address it.\u201dAdvertisementKraft\u2019s plan takes considerable cues from the version of rent control that Wu tried unsuccessfully to push through the state Legislature in 2023. Like Wu\u2019s plan, it would tie allowable rent hikes to inflation, with a hard cap of 10 percent per year. While Wu\u2019s set no income guidelines, Kraft\u2019s plan would be open to tenants who make less than 200 percent of the Area Median Income, more than $300,000 for a family of four, which he said would prevent luxury buildings from participating.Mayor Michelle Wu looked on as the City Council voted to approve her proposal to restore rent control in Boston in 2023. The measure later died on Beacon Hill.Jonathan Wiggs/Globe StaffThe biggest differences are that Kraft\u2019s program would be optional for landlords, and would come with a sweetener: property tax breaks of 20 percent for participating buildings. Kraft said he\u2019d pay for that with tax revenue generated by new residential construction, which he hopes to spark by lowering affordable housing requirements.The city requires 20 percent of units in new developments to be set aside at affordable rents. Kraft wants to lower it to 13 percent, the rule that was in place before Wu took office.Kraft\u2019s campaign said that because the money would be distributed to landlords in the form of grants, as opposed to formal tax rebates, his plan would not need to go through the state Legislature (though that point is disputed by some advocates and legislators).\u201cJosh\u2019s opt-in rent control plan would provide real relief to renters, unlike Mayor Wu\u2019s failed plan that has helped no one,\u201d the Kraft campaign said in a statement. \u201cThis is yet another unfulfilled promise which Mayor Wu needs to explain to voters instead of calling names and making excuses.\u201dRelated: Who is Josh Kraft, the nonprofit leader and son of the Patriots owner challenging Michelle Wu for mayor?AdvertisementFor her part, Wu assailed Kraft\u2019s plan, calling it \u201cfake rent control.\u201d She said he is using the promise of rent control to win over struggling renters who are hurting, while offering them no real protections.\u201cThis program, a voluntary program, is not going to \u2026 protect against the worst offenders [of extreme rent hikes],\u201d Wu said on GBH\u2019s Boston Public Radio last week. \u201cIt is a use of resources without offering the types of protections that we really need.\u201dWu has not reintroduced her rent control plan since it died in the Legislature last year.So far, no prominent tenant groups have come out in support of Kraft\u2019s plan, but it\u2019s getting a positive reception among some real estate interests, who lobbied against Wu\u2019s plan and ultimately helped sink it on Beacon Hill.Developers and landlords generally oppose mandatory rent caps because they limit a building\u2019s profitability, making it more difficult to attract the investors needed to build and therefore slowing new construction. They\u2019re also a political constituency that appears at least intrigued by \u2014 if not yet openly supportive of \u2014 Kraft\u2019s candidacy.\u201cWe have long been opposed to rent control because we have seen the impact it has on housing production,\u201d said Tamara Small, chief executive of real estate trade group NAIOP Massachusetts, which does not endorse political candidates. \u201cWhen the investors that finance housing development hear the words rent control, they flee. But this proposal is clearly different. I don\u2019t think it would hurt production the way [Wu\u2019s] proposal would.\u201dAdvertisementAn apartment building under construction in Jamaica Plain last year. New construction has slowed in Boston amid higher interest rates and materials costs. Mayoral challenger Josh Kraft has said he'd lower affordable housing requirements to help boost new projects.Jessica Rinaldi/Globe StaffWhile it\u2019s unclear how many landlords may opt in to such a program, some have already indicated they may be interested. In some cases, the program may actually be profitable for landlords, as they\u2019d get tax breaks even in years when they wouldn\u2019t normally raise the rent above the proposed cap.Take Chris Lehman, cofounder of real estate investment group Groma. His group typically raises rent by an average of 3 to 5 percent a year across its more than 300-unit portfolio, well below the cap Kraft proposes. He conducted a financial feasibility analysis of Kraft\u2019s plan at the request of his campaign, and found that savings on taxes would make up for lost rent. He said he would consider enrolling the majority of his units.Related: Lessons in modern-day rent control, 3,000 miles from Boston\u201cIf there were an actual rent control, we would of course oppose it,\u201d he said. \u201dBut this program could mean lower rent increases for our residents without hurting development.\u201dWhat remains to be seen is whether Kraft\u2019s rent moderation policy will be enough to win over housing advocates and tenants who have historically come out in force for Wu and who have often demanded stronger affordability requirements in new development. At least one group of advocates, the Coalition for a Truly Affordable Boston, is more focused on his plan to cut affordability, which they called a \u201cdirect attack on Boston\u2019s affordability and housing justice efforts.\u201d\u201cIncreasing housing supply alone does not guarantee affordability \u2014 especially when developers are not required to build homes that meet the needs of our residents,\u201d said Shameeka Moreno, a member of the Boston Tenant Coalition.AdvertisementAnd lawmakers who\u2019ve long worked on housing issues say they\u2019re skeptical that Kraft\u2019s plan would generate enough affordable units to cancel out the ones lost by lowering affordable housing requirements, or do much to control Boston\u2019s soaring rents at all.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know the meaning of the words he\u2019s using \u2014 it\u2019s not rent control,\u201d said State Senator Lydia Edwards, a Wu ally and former city councilor from East Boston. \u201cI welcome creative policy solutions and that this is a major issue in the mayor\u2019s race. But this feels like he\u2019s using the term rent control in order to try to get some attention and some headlines.\u201dAndrew Brinker can be reached at andrew.brinker@globe.com.

        "content": "The stately brick homes on Beacon Hill aren\u2019t the only real estate that\u2019s selling for a premium fee.A single parking spot in a garage on Brimmer Street is on the market for $750,000, according to a real estate listing posted last week. It\u2019s just the latest spot to notch a steep price tag in the neighborhood, where it seems the only thing more coveted than housing is parking.\u201cIt\u2019s a great long-term hold,\u201d said Rene Rodriguez, a realtor for Cabot & Company and one of the spot\u2019s two listing agents. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to be building any more parking on the hill.\u201dThe parking space, first reported on by the Boston Herald, is located in a luxury garage just off Storrow Drive that offers refueling, car washing, and other concierge services, according to the listing.AdvertisementRodriguez said the spot belongs to a family that recently closed a deal to sell their home in the neighborhood. Some potential buyers have shown interest in the space, but it was still \u201cvery much available\u201d as of Thursday, he added.Brimmer Street Garage, which bills itself as Beacon Hill\u2019s \u201cmost exclusive venue to capture a parking space,\u201d operates as a condominium; the spots are sold privately as deeded, taxable pieces of property.When homes are sold on Beacon Hill, the sellers usually include the value of their parking spaces in the overall sale price. Oftentimes, the deeds to the spaces are transferred by a symbolic payment, Rodriguez said.\u201cWhen [sellers] go to record the sale of the house, they also record the sale of the parking because it\u2019s a fully separate deed, and they\u2019ll just record it as $1,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we actually don\u2019t know what the true value was ... for that parking space.\u201dBut when parking spaces come on the market separately, they can fetch well over half a million dollars.\u201cThe owners of this space thought it made more sense to bring it to market and see what the market would bear,\u201d Rodriguez said.In 1979, single parking spaces at the Brimmer were being sold for $7,500, or roughly $35,000 in today\u2019s money, according to the garage\u2019s website.AdvertisementLast year, the most expensive parking spot in the garage sold for $565,000, Rodriguez said.It\u2019s rare for a parking space at a \u201cfull service\u201d garage like the Brimmer to come on the market, he said.\u201cIf you\u2019re spending $5 million, $10 million, $20 million for a house on the Hill and you don\u2019t have any parking \u2014 at that point, for purchasing a spot, it becomes splitting hairs whether you pay $500,000 or $600,[000] or $700,000,\u201d he said.Camilo Fonseca can be reached at camilo.fonseca@globe.com.

        "subhead": "Apartment buildings need a lot of wood. And around here, wood mostly comes from Canada.",
        "content": "There are two main ingredients in cost of building housing: labor and materials. Here in New England especially \u2014 where builders have long wrestled with the cost of construction \u2014 the 25 percent tariff on Canadian imports instituted this week by President Trump will make the latter even more expensive.Much of the softwood lumber and mass timber that goes into apartment buildings in Massachusetts comes from Canada, as does fabricated steel and aluminum. While costs vary, it\u2019s typical for materials to make up between 40 and 50 percent of a construction budget \u2014 with anywhere from 6 to 12 percent of that coming from imported goods, said Mike Kearns, chief operating officer of the New England region for construction management firm Shawmut Design and Construction in Boston.New tariffs are likely to spark a domino effect on costs, he says. A 25 percent premium on Canadian lumber could prompt a run on domestic suppliers \u2014 a market that\u2019s already at maximum capacity, Kearns said \u2014 which will in turn likely bring those domestic prices up, and further extend an already stressed supply chain.Related: The $600,000 problem: Why it costs so much to build housing in Greater BostonAdvertisementBuilders are constantly on the hunt for ways to bring costs down, but the tariffs are likely to affect whether a project\u2019s economics work \u2014 and whether builders can build. Indeed, in the Northeast, lumber costs comprise typically 15 to 18 percent of the cost of building a new home.\u201cIt\u2019s always this balancing act,\u201d Kearns said. \u201cIf that value proposition isn\u2019t there, then that\u2019s when you could see something pause.\u201dKearns stressed, however, that the industry is \u201ca long way from seeing [tariffs] shut down work,\u201d and that there are ways to navigate costs.Still, any adjustment in the existing tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber results in almost universal groans among wood suppliers who watch the changes closely, said Paul Rogers, purchasing manager at Shepley Wood Products, a supplier with offices in Hyannis, Nantucket, and Wellfleet. If the price of Canadian lumber effectively goes up 25 percent, the price charged by American mills in turn \u201cgoes up in sympathy,\u201d Rogers said.\u201cEverybody follows the numbers,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what side of the border it\u2019s coming from.\u201dAdvertisementThe margin on lumber is already slim \u2014 \u201cin the single digits,\u201d Rogers said \u2014 and tariffs further limit a lumber supplier\u2019s ability to negotiate pricing. Canadian softwood lumber like spruce, pine, and fir have carried tariffs since 1980, said Shepley president Tony Shepley. Now those will go up even higher.An apartment building under construction in Everett in 2023.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffFor development projects in the Northeast, architects will often specify that they want Canadian softwood lumber \u2014 both for how it\u2019s grown and how it survives in the Northeastern climate, said Rita Ferris, president of the Northeastern Retail Lumber Association, which represents independent lumber and building material suppliers from Maine to Washington, D.C.There\u2019s huge concern about tariffs further slowing development of residential housing, which has already faced huge cost pressures, Ferris said.\u201cWe just don\u2019t grow enough of our own to meet our own demands,\u201d Ferris said. \u201cWe totally get the goal of putting America first and having American workers and all of that. But if you can\u2019t supply yourself, it\u2019s really an extra burden.\u201dTariffs are of course nothing new to the construction industry. Prior presidential administrations have instituted tariffs on materials including steel and lumber, boosting their overall price, wrote Paul Brussow, president of Rider Levett Bucknall North America, in the firm\u2019s recent quarterly construction cost report. That report saw typical costs in Boston climb 5.4 percent over the last year, second only to Chicago among major markets.\u201cWhile tariffs have had an impact, it was nothing compared to what inflation has done in recent years,\u201d Brussow wrote in January. \u201cWhen coupled with inflation and labor shortages, this trifecta, in the last few years, has strained supply chains, raised construction costs, and affected project timelines.\u201dRelated: A 10,000-unit housing development at Suffolk Downs is on hold indefinitely. Here\u2019s why.AdvertisementAdditional tariffs \u201care more likely to exacerbate these challenges, particularly for metals, plastics, and essential construction materials, potentially adding thousands to the cost of residential and commercial projects,\u201d Brussow wrote.For Riverdale Mills, a Northbridge company that makes steel wire mesh used in products like fences and lobster traps, the new tariffs are a one-two punch of bad news. Riverdale buys much of its steel from Canada \u2014 and an additional 25 percent tariff on steel will kick in on March 12. So by mid-month, the company will be paying 50 percent more for its most important raw material.The company\u2019s chief executive, James Knott Jr., said Riverdale can\u2019t avoid the tariffs by buying American steel, because US steelmakers used the tariffs as an excuse to jack up their own prices. They didn\u2019t even wait for the tariffs to begin.\u201cBack in February, the domestic guys all raised their prices in advance of those tariffs,\u201d Knott said.Knott has no intention of switching to a US source.\u201cRather than buy from a domestic supplier, I\u2019m going to buy from my reliable supplier in Canada,\u201d said Knott, \u201cbecause all the prices are equal.\u201dIronically, Knott said that most of the US suppliers are foreign-owned, but his Canadian supplier is owned by a US firm.The tariffs will harm him in another way, said Knott. About 35 to 45 percent of Riverdale\u2019s products are exported. But since the tariffs have boosted his production costs, his exported steel mesh will be too expensive to compete on world markets.Meanwhile Shepley of Shepley Wood Products said he would hope for \u201ccommon sense and cooler heads\u201d to prevail.Advertisement\u201cIt\u2019s our mission as an industry to protect consumers, to not let housing get driven further out of reach, and to get things settled down,\u201d Shepley said. \u201cSo this was a bit of a shock to the system, but we\u2019ll hope that everybody pulls themselves together and gets this going.\u201dSteel and lumber, two major components in housing construction, both face substantial price increases amid 25 percent tariffs on imports from Canada.David L.

Rockpoint and Wells Fargo both declined to comment, while a representative for Newmark did not respond.The complex spans about 853,000 square feet and is about 71 percent occupied, according to data from real estate firm CoStar Group.Related: One of Boston\u2019s skyline-defining towers is on the auction block \u2014 and expected to sell at a big discountThe pending sale comes amid a broad price reset for Boston\u2019s office market, with a growing roster of towers going up for sale for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic shook up demand for office space. Real estate experts expect downtown properties could be worth between 40 percent and 60 percent less than they were prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and several recent sales bear out that thesis.Rockpoint Group has owned 75-101 Federal, at least in part, since 2015, when it purchased the conjoined offices for $326.5 million. Rockpoint sold a 50 percent stake in the buildings to Carr Properties in March 2020 \u2014 the very same week COVID was declared a national emergency \u2014 for about $185 more per square foot than it had paid five years previously. (Carr sold its stake back to Rockpoint last year for an undisclosed price). Also that week, Rockpoint and Carr finalized a $292 million mortgage with Wells Fargo, according to Suffolk County records, a mortgage with a maturity date of March 12, 2025.AdvertisementThe 75-101 Federal St. buildings have entrances on both Federal and Devonshire streets in downtown Boston. Here, one of the towers is reflected in the facade of 100 Federal St. David L. Ryan/Globe StaffThe brick and stone 75 Federal St. building dates to 1929 and was once described by the Boston Landmarks Commission as \u201cthe most elaborately decorative Art Deco skyscraper standing in Boston.\u201d The 31-story tower at 101 Federal St. was built as an adjoining office in 1988. The towers are connected by a block-long lobby linking their two entrances \u2014 one on Federal Street, the other on Devonshire Street \u2014 that was renovated in 2016.AdvertisementTwo real estate industry sources said Rockpoint and Wells Fargo are working closely on the sale and collectively decided to bring Newmark\u2019s capital markets team in to market the property. The 262,000-square-foot 75 Federal St. is 78 percent occupied, while the 591,000-square-foot 101 Federal St. is 64 percent occupied, according to CoStar.Related: Take a look at the first skyscraper proposed in downtown Boston since the pandemicIt\u2019s not clear for how much the towers could sell. Several recent deals have seen properties trade at big discounts, with significant implications for both the city\u2019s tax base and their owners\u2019 balance sheets.For example, after purchasing 179 Lincoln St. near South Station in January 2020 for $155.7 million, a Blackstone entity sold the five-story building to Boston\u2019s Synergy Investments last March for $76.5 million \u2014 a 51 percent price decline, according to research from Avison Young. Also last March, Synergy purchased 101 Arch St. in Downtown Crossing for $78 million \u2014 some 36 percent less than it sold for in 2005, and some $11 million less than the property had sold for in 2002.Catherine Carlock can be reached at catherine.carlock@globe.com.

        "content": "Developers working with the Boston Housing Authority have obtained $70 million in backing for the first phase of a long-planned redevelopment of South Boston\u2019s Mary Ellen McCormack public housing complex, one of the oldest public housing projects in America.WinnCompanies and the BHA on Thursday said the financing would allow construction of a 112,000-square-foot building with 94 new apartments designated for low-income families who already live at the complex. Under a plan approved in 2023, Winn and the authority plan to raise /$2 billion over the next two decades to redevelop the entire 30-acre complex into a mixed-income, mixed-use property with 3,300 apartments, retail space, and a community center.The first phase, dubbed Building A, will also include a new Veterans Park with an accessible tot lot, bike lane, new trees, and reconfigured streets safer for pedestrians.Advertisement\u201cFor almost nine decades, Mary Ellen McCormack has been a cornerstone of Boston\u2019s commitment to affordable housing,\u201d Boston Mayor Michelle Wu said in a statement. \u201cToday, we take a major step forward in ensuring that this historic community remains a vibrant, inclusive home for generations to come.\u201dTenants have been involved in planning the entire project, according to Carol Sullivan, executive director of the Mary Ellen McCormack Task Force, a resident advocacy group. \u201cI am very proud of this partnership and cannot wait to see the smiles on the residents\u2019 faces when they move into their new, affordable homes,\u201d Sullivan said in a statement.An artist's rendering of the first building in the planned redevelopment of South Boston's Mary Ellen McCormack public housing complex.The Architectural TeamWinnCompanies chief executive Gilbert Winn said the redevelopment project would be a model for similar projects across the country. \u201cThis first building jumpstarts an ambitious and inspired undertaking many years in the making that will ultimately give rise to a new mixed-income and mixed-use neighborhood,\u201d Winn said in a statement.Ed Flynn, who represents the McCormack area on the City Council, said the redevelopment\u2019s new park and community center will offer improvements to benefit all South Boston residents. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be more excited to see it through to completion in 2026,\u201d Flynn said in an email.The project\u2019s financing, $62 million for the building and $8 million for infrastructure, came from a variety of sources including a construction loan from Bank of America, federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit and Energy Tax Credit equity from Bank of America, a tax-exempt bridge loan and tax-exempt first mortgage loan from MassHousing, and a subordinate loan from the Affordable Housing Trust Fund maintained by the Massachusetts Executive Office of Housing & Livable Communities.AdvertisementThe McCormack project, built during the Great Depression, currently includes 1,016 deeply subsidized apartments across 35 buildings.

        "content": "For the last six years, Annie Gordon has not gone a day without worrying about facing eviction or a huge rent increase.Now, she can relax.Developer Related Beal, with financial backing from the City of Boston, is buying the 347-unit Mattapan apartment complex where Gordon has lived for nearly 50 years and setting rents at affordable rates, putting an end to a lengthy saga that saw fixed-income tenants battle with a landlord that bought the property in 2018 and raised rents dramatically.\u201cThe feeling is overwhelming relief,\u201d said Gordon, who is 74. \u201cWhen I got the call with the news, I couldn\u2019t even believe it because we\u2019ve been fighting, trying to stay in our homes for so long. There\u2019s still a part of me that can\u2019t believe it. We fought so hard, and we actually won.\u201dAdvertisementSome tenants wept when they heard the news, Gordon said.\u201cThe toll this took on all of us,\u201d she said, \u201cwas huge.\u201dThe city is contributing more than $10 million to the purchase to guarantee affordable rents for all of the units, as well as protections against big rent increases, officials said at a press conference at Fairlawn Estates, as the property was known before it was purchased in 2018. Half of the units will be set at rents affordable to tenants making 60 percent of the area median income, or $78,360 for a household of two, and the other half will be set at 80 percent AMI. Related\u2019s deal with the city also caps annual rent increases at 2 percent a year.Related\u2019s affiliate, Related Affordable, would not say how much they are spending to purchase the 12-building property, but DSF Group paid $65 million to buy it in 2018.Boston\u2019s $10 million contribution is coming through its Acquisition Opportunity Program, which provides funding to community and housing groups to finance the purchase of market-rate housing to be maintained as permanently affordable. The groups behind the transactions can borrow against the city\u2019s contribution to obtain additional capital. In this case, the city said it was able to secure nine times its $10 million investment in private funds.At 347 units, Related\u2019s purchase of the Mattapan property is by far the largest such acquisition under the AOP. In 2022, the city helped finance the purchase of 36 small apartment buildings totaling 114 apartments in East Boston for affordable housing.Related: Leader of Mattapan tenant organization staves off eviction ... for nowAdvertisementThe program is part of a broader strategy by Mayor Michelle Wu that has seen the city pour hundreds of millions of pandemic recovery dollars into the construction and acquisition of affordable housing. By purchasing market-rate homes, the city can avoid the prohibitive costs it takes to build new affordable housing, while maintaining buildings in neighborhoods that are gentrifying rapidly.\u201cThe City of Boston is so proud to play a role in restoring Fairlawn as an affordable home, because for decades, these units were known that way: an affordable place to raise a family,\u201d Wu said Monday. \u201cOver the last few years especially, the rent here was hiked up ... and families were forced out of Fairlawn, out of Mattapan, and out of the city.\u201dNow, \u201cit\u2019s a new day,\u201d said city housing chief Sheila Dillon.Fairlawn was built in the 1960s off Mattapan\u2019s Bismarck Street, and it eventually became a community cornerstone because its cheap rents supported a community of longtime tenants, some of whom live on fixed incomes.Annie Gordon in her Mattapan apartment in June 2020.Pat Greenhouse/Globe StaffA few of those tenants spent years advocating for the addition of the Mattapan commuter rail stop, but when it was finally built, the apartment complex became attractive for prospective investors, Gordon said.That\u2019s when DSF bought the place. Rents immediately rose, in some cases, by hundreds of dollars. Many tenants couldn\u2019t afford the increases. Some left, but others stayed and fought, refusing to pay the increases and forming a tenant association with the help of tenant group City Life/Vida Urbana.Related: From 2022: In East Boston, a big move to keep renters in their homesAdvertisementLast year, DSF moved to evict Gordon, but a judge sided with her and let her stay.\u201cTenants have been traumatized by this,\u201d said Gabrielle Rene, the Mattapan community organizer for City Life. \u201cThis has been years of pain and struggle.\u201dThe saga at Fairlawn Estates highlights how vulnerable many residents of the city are to big rent increases, and why policy makers should prioritize protections for renters, said Gordon. People like Gordon would benefit directly from something like rent control, she said. And the city should also pass the Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act, which would require landlords to give tenants and housing groups the opportunity to purchase apartment buildings before they go up for sale on the private market, she said.Related\u2019s purchase is a rare victory for tenants in a city where apartment buildings change hands and rents soar frequently. Many of those sales have much different endings.\u201cWe\u2019re grateful,\u201d said Gordon. \u201cI\u2019m grateful I get to stay in my home.\u201dResidents and advocates gave a round of applause during the announcement Monday.

Now a bead of sweat dribbles down the side of his forehead as he leads a trio of Northeastern University students in sweatpants back down four flights of creaking stairs and into a narrow basement.Roughly 10 minutes of searching and two calls to the building owner later, he finally discovers apartment 41A, at the bottom of an outdoor staircase that is hidden by a stand of bushes.Now, he can go to work.The current occupants of unit 41A sit awkwardly in their bedrooms as Macdonald leads the students around the basement apartment. The place smells vaguely of cat urine, and there is a network of pipes running across the ceiling that may, or may not, transport the building\u2019s sewage. Macdonald explains that if they want a three-bedroom for around $4,500, this is the most spacious option they\u2019ll find.Related: What\u2019s the rent where you live?

And after New York City outlawed tenant-paid broker fees last year, Boston and neighboring cities like Cambridge and Somerville constitute the only major urban center in the United States where renters are obligated to pay.Related: Renters hate to pay broker fees. Could this be the year those fees go away?That could soon change. Momentum is building for a law in Boston that would charge the fees to whoever hires the broker between the landlord and the renter, rather than allowing landlords to decide. Key legislators have signaled their support, and Governor Maura Healey has signed on.Some brokers have taken that recent push as an affront on their profession, and warn that the housing market cannot function without them. Their job, they say, is to find renters a good deal.Renters aren\u2019t so sure.\u201cWe\u2019re expected to pay this guy?\u201d one of the students remarked under his breath as Macdonald wandered through the Symphony building searching for apartment 41A.Macdonald has only been a broker for a few years, but he knows the business. He wears a navy suit bulky enough for a professional wrestler and oozes with the confidence of a 22-year-old, which he is. He crushes energy drinks instead of coffee, and the empty cans litter his car\u2019s floorboards. He fires off text messages at red lights, because, he says, \u201ctime is money.\u201d He hopes to parlay the money he makes leasing rentals into investment properties someday.Related: NYC is about to make landlords cover most brokers fees. Will Boston follow suit?Macdonald is the youngest broker at Jacob Realty on Newbury Street, one of a handful of brokerages run by Boston real estate mogul Demetrios Salpoglou. He lives with his parents in New Hampshire and starts his day around 7:30 a.m., after an hour\u2019s drive to work.AdvertisementOn a recent day, Macdonald settles into his desk near a drafty window overlooking Newbury Street. The room fills with chatter of brokers calling landlords and loudly drafting voice-to-text messages to prospective tenants. In a back room, there is a wall with thousands of keys to apartments Jacob helps rent.Thomas Macdonald sat at his desk in the Jacob Realty office on Newbury Street.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffMacdonald usually starts his days scanning Salpoglou\u2019s database of 215,000 rental units for apartments that are about to hit the market or that have lingered for awhile.This morning, he has spotted a couple of one-bedrooms in Allston that are about to hit the market, both renting for over $2,000 a month.\u201cCan you make the moving costs any easier?\u201d he asks the landlord on the phone, angling for a sweetener he can offer would-be tenants, like a break on the security deposit.The landlord says no.Real estate brokers have been around in Boston for as long as people have needed homes. Brokers say they serve an important purpose: helping people navigate the cutthroat housing market to find a home where they can build their lives. But they tend to work mostly on behalf of landlords in this housing market, where homes are in high demand. Those owners typically have enough leverage to push the broker fee off to their tenants.Sites like Zillow and Apartment List allow apartment-hunters to narrow down options, but in many cases, they can\u2019t tour a unit without interacting with a broker who has listed the place on a landlord\u2019s behalf.It can be a lucrative venture. Macdonald would not say how much he makes in a year, but its an eat-what-you-kill business. Most rental brokers\u2019 compensation consists entirely of fees they charge on apartment rentals, and it can vary widely from broker to broker. A successful broker can easily make six figures by leasing expensive apartments at an efficient clip. Others who lease just a few units a month make considerably less. There are thousands of brokers in Boston battling for the listings and leases of the city\u2019s more than 300,000 apartments. On Newbury Street alone, there are several dozen brokerages.Advertisement\u201cBrokers and leasing agents provide a valuable service, and we get compensated for those services,\u201d said Eric Shabshelowitz, vice president of the luxury real estate agency Cabot & Company. \u201cYears ago, it was landlords who paid the fee, but the market has changed.\u201dRelated: Governor Healey announces plan to eliminate renter-paid broker feesSome brokers focus on hawking cheaper rentals to Boston\u2019s flood of college students. Others work in specific neighborhoods.Rob Oteri, who founded the rental site JPRentals, focuses mainly on apartments in Jamaica Plain, where he lives. He said he tries to maintain personal relationships with landlords and works diligently with prospective renters to help them find the best place for them in their price range.When brokers do their job well, Oteri said, the fee shouldn\u2019t be quite so painful. But theirs is a volume business, and some brokers simply try to lease as many units as possible as quickly as possible. That leads to instances, he said, when brokers show up to lead apartment tours without ever having seen the unit.\u201cI certainly understand the frustration with some brokers who maybe have a \u2018turn and burn\u2019 mentality about the work,\u201d Oteri said. \u201cBut a good broker earns their money by working closely with tenants to get them the best deal.\u201dAdvertisementMacdonald\u2019s day has taken him into Allston, near Commonwealth Avenue, where he has picked up keys from one of the city\u2019s biggest student landlords, Alpha Management, so he can take photos of Alpha apartments that will soon come on the market.His first stop is a clean but tiny one-bedroom with a closet too thin for a person to stand in. It has nice natural light and a full kitchen.\u201cThis one will go fast,\u201d he says while taking note of the \u201cstandalone closet.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas Macdonald checks out an apartment in Allston before creating a listing on his brokerage's website.\n   \t\t(John Tlumacki/Globe Staff)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Macdonald on the phone in the Jacob Realty office.\n   \t\t\t\t (John Tlumacki/Globe Staff)\n\nAs he drives toward his next stop, he defends the value of his profession.Finding apartments without brokers, he says, would be harder, because there would be no one to cultivate and centralize listings and organize tours. And his knowledge of the market helps him find renters the best deals, which is his top priority.\u201cIt\u2019s the free market,\u201d he says. \u201cI love it.\u201dRelated: Renters are vexed by broker fees.

        "content": "ByRobyn A. Friedman -- Globe Correspondent\nIf you\u2019re buying a condo, you\u2019ve probably reviewed the rules and regulations of the condominium association to confirm they don\u2019t conflict with your planned use of the property. But did you check out the association itself? Failing to ensure that the association\u2019s finances are healthy can lead to huge bills for unsuspecting unit owners.\n\u201cThe worst-case scenario is that a buyer could have a special assessment in the thousands of dollars,\u2019\u2019 saidLinda Barrett, vice president of Douglas Elliman Real Estate in Boston. \u201cShould the building\u2019s roof need to be replaced, you could end up with a very high special assessment if the association does not have good reserves.\u2019\u2019\nOwners of condominiums pay regular assessments, usually monthly or quarterly, to cover the operating expenses of the association, as well as reserves \u2014 funds stashed away for future capital projects. But condo associations also can charge unit owners special assessments for emergencies or unusual circumstances, such as damage to the building caused by a winter storm.\nThat\u2019s why Barrett always prepares her condo buyers beforehand. \u201cIt\u2019s my job to make sure buyers not only review the condominium documents, but two years of the budget as well,\u2019\u2019 she said. When she writes an offer, she also includes a contingency allowing the buyer to review the minutes of association board meetings for the past two years. \u201cYou could read in the minutes from a year ago that there\u2019s a problem with the roof,\u2019\u2019 she said. That could signal that a special assessment is in your future.\nRelatedSticker shock: Special assessments can send condo costs even higher. What buyers should be asking.\n\nPrior to closing on a one-bedroom condominium in Boston\u2019s Seaport District two years ago, Anne Stemlar, a legal administrator in Boston, reviewed the association\u2019s financial statements. \u201cI was looking at the health of the organization and what kind of financial reserves they had,\u2019\u2019 Stemlar said.\nStemlar concluded that the association was well run, with healthy reserves, a capital budget, and a plan for improvements. But she had an advantage since she had owned two units previously and served on a condo association board of directors. First-time buyers should rely on their real estate agent and lawyer for help reviewing these documents. \u201cAsk a lot of questions, and make sure you come to a comfort level,\u2019\u2019 Stemlar said.\nIn addition to reviewing the rules and regulations of the association to ensure you won\u2019t be in violation if you own a large dog, drive a truck, or want to rent your unit, be sure to conduct the following due diligence on the financial stability of the association:\n\u25a0\u00a0Review the past two operating budgets, as well as two years\u2019 worth of board and annual meeting minutes. Be wary if assessments haven\u2019t increased over time; since the cost of goods and services have gone up, maintenance fees should have followed.\n\u25a0\u00a0Review the reserve study of the major capital components of the building, and make sure there are adequate funds to replace them on schedule.\n\u25a0\u00a0Ask questions. Dawn Bauman, senior vice president for government and public affairs at theCommunity Associations Institute, an industry group, said condo buyers should inquire about routine maintenance of the building, whether the board expects to increase assessments, and whether there is a current special assessment or one pending or imminent. Try to talk to the seller, the property manager, and board members.\n\u25a0\u00a0Be skeptical about the operating budget for new construction. Developers often subsidize the expenses of the association by paying costs such as landscaping or snow removal, so it\u2019s common for assessments to increase once the unit owners take control of the association.\n\u25a0\u00a0Don\u2019t ignore insurance.Spencer M. Houldin, president of Ericson Insurance Advisors in Boston, suggested that condo buyers determine the insurance obligations of both the association and the unit owners. Typically, Houldin said, the association insures the building, while owners are responsible for everything inside their units. Have your insurance agent or lawyer review the association\u2019s insurance to make sure it\u2019s sufficient to rebuild the structure. All unit owners should carry anHO-6 policythat covers the interior of their units and liability.\n\u25a0\u00a0Don\u2019t waive your right to review association financials. \u201cIt\u2019s a seller\u2019s market, and buyers are willing to overlook things like reserves because they\u2019re just happy they found a place and their offer was accepted,\u2019\u2019 saidMichael Merrill, a real estate and condominium law attorney in Boston. But even if you waive mortgage and inspection contingencies, be wary of waiving a budget review.\n\u201cThat way, when you do become an owner, you\u2019re not surprised by the amount of money you may have to put in to solve a problem,\u2019\u2019 Merrill said.\nRobyn A.

        "content": "By Lindsay Crudele, The Boston Globe\n\nWhen it comes to online gardening trends and how they translate to reality, mileage can vary.\n\n\u201cChaos gardening\u201d lit upTikToklast year, its advocates tossing fistfuls of seed into soil \u2014 or even grass \u2014 while seeming to hope fora wildflower meadow. There are reasons that a planned approach can yield more reliable results: crowding plants can outcompete one another, and not all seeds will thrive in every yard placement. But for some who practice it in the Boston area, chaos gardening is more than an online trend: It\u2019s a longtime mindset they say has helped them maintain a more forgiving relationship with their spaces, easing up on their expectations and enjoying the garden on its own terms.\n\n\u201cI do have ideas for what I want to grow, but whatever works,\u201d said Dana Werbin, who gardens in Jamaica Plain. \u201cIf a seed grows there, that means it likes the conditions.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not that Werbin\u2019s approach lacks design: It\u2019s just that the garden is, to a greater extent than some, also the designer. Their \u201cvolunteer\u201d tomatoes \u2014 ones that sprout from dropped seeds, tend to do better than planted seedlings, for example.\n\n\u201cI could make the decision to rip it up and plant it elsewhere, but it already made the decision that it likes where it is, so I\u2019m not gonna mess that up,\u201d they said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s going to give me good tomatoes.\u201d\n\nWerbin\u2019s description of their garden is a picture of both chaos and order. They don\u2019t know exactly where something will grow, but the garden will let them know. That\u2019s where they will find the scallions this season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a percentage of, like, 70 percent chaos, 30 percent order,\u201d they said.\n\nFor Kris Engdahl, the decision opened up a neighborhood conversation.\n\n\nShe sees her chaos garden approach as an outcropping ofmilpa gardening, a sustainable and regenerative indigenous practice related to the \u201cthree sisters\u201d method of planting corn, beans, and squash together. Engdahl\u2019s Watertown front yard received a lot of street salt, which seemed to encourage crabgrass. So, she tore it up and tried flowers: roses, marigolds, and impatiens. But her interest turned to growing food, and she thought,why not?She replaced flowers with a range of vegetables and herbs. Sometimes she added more flowers. Sometimes, tricolor chard. She followed her whims, and soon the garden followed its own.\n\n\nAs  it evolved, the garden\u2019s proximity to the sidewalk attracted interest. Located a short walk to a community path, the foot traffic is frequent. The variety became a magnetic conversation-starter. A group of passersby, with her permission, harvested cilantro. A woman took chard and returned the next day with a delicious recipe she made with it.\n\nWith each season, different plantings would express themselves with more or less influence. One year, Engdahl\u2019s garden was dominated by dill and daikon (white radish). Sometimes pumpkins popped up; sometimes green beans would thrive.\n\nAnd while it can feel that way to Engdahl, to its admirers, the garden was not independent from its gardener. Last year, Engdahl said she fell behind on maintenance \u2014 stymied, as we all experience \u2014 by life and the heat wave. And even during these cold intermediate months, someone checked in.\n\n\u201cI had somebody on Sunday [ask]: \u2018How are you doing? We love looking at your garden. I was concerned about you,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nSometimes the balance will seem off in some way, and Engdahl will correct it. One season\u2019s parsley, which produced months of winter broths, became next season\u2019s rabbit food.\n\n\u201cSometimes I will do something, and it will be wrong, but gardens are dynamic,\u201d she said. She plans to continue this year, following up on her practice of \u201cno dig\u201d gardening, adding her own homemade compost.\n\nGarden designerDemetra Tseckareshas found the chaos gardening mindset useful when responding to clients who are looking for lower maintenance. Meadows are a great fit for replacing a sunny lawn. Tseckares will hand-seed the area, but is careful to select intentionally, avoiding pre-sold mixes that can often include invasive or aggressive plant species.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to get people to understand what a beautiful garden looks like in a different way, because these super neat, super tidy \u2026 cleaned-up gardens that don\u2019t allow a single leaf or a single stem to stand are dead zones, they kill an entire generation,\u201d Tseckares said of the insects that may use stems and leaves for habitat, supporting other parts of the wildlife population.\n\nAnd it\u2019s a more sustainable approach \u2014 including financially.\n\n\u201cYou can change it every year, or it will just do its own thing,\u201d she said, noting that gardeners can harvest seeds at the end of the season for next year\u2019s plantings.\n\nWerbin\u2019s next season, like many gardeners, will begin well before the last frost. Using a small greenhouse, they will start seedlings during the cold season. But they also will practice experimental sowing with a packet of their own mixed seeds as an intentional surprise, to see what comes up.\n\nNot every experiment is fruitful. Last year, Werbin nurtured a plant they thought was ginger. It turned out to be grass.\n\n\u201cI was giving so much love to this weed, thinking that it was going to turn into something, and it wasn\u2019t,\u201d they said.\n\nBut care and forgiveness are never wasted. Now Werbin, who has a professional horticulture background, is studying for a career pivot into nursing.\n\n\u201cCultivating a rapport with your patients is just like getting the soil ready,\u201d she said. Their approach to gardening required openness and nonjudgmental thinking. They talk to their plants. And they are carrying that practice into their nursing study.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be the same student nurse, if I didn\u2019t have that experience,\u201d said Werbin.\n\nLindsay Crudele can be reached at[email\u00a0protected].\n\n\nAddress NewsletterOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.Submit your emailEnter your email addressSign up\nOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.\n\n\u00a92025 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

        "subhead": "Wishing you could buy a home? It can be challenging to save enough for a down payment, given how much houses now cost.",
        "content": "By Ann Carrns, New York Times Service\n\nWishing you could buy a home? It can be challenging to save enough for a down payment, given how much houses now cost.\n\nBut many people don\u2019t realize myriad programs offer grants or loans to help home buyers come up with the necessary funds. \u201cThere are tons of programs to assist them,\u201d said Deatra Kemp, an advocate for first-time home buyers in Milwaukee.\n\nThe programs can ease some of the daunting numbers behind buying a house. The median price of a home has risen to more than $400,000, meaning the once-traditional 20 percent down payment \u2014 an amount paid in cash toward the purchase of a home, in addition to the amount borrowed for a mortgage \u2014 would be about $80,000. And typical house prices are significantly higher in some parts of the country like Massachusetts. The Warren Group reported Tuesday that the median sales price for a single-family home in the state hit $615,000 in December, a year-over-year jump of 11.1 percent. The median condo price in Massachusetts was $521,750, a 5 percent increase.\n\nEven putting down 5 percent to 10 percent is a stretch because rising rents have made it harder for people to save, said Teig Whaley-Smith, chief alliance executive for the Community Development Alliance, a nonprofit group in Milwaukee that promotes affordable homeownership as a path to racial equity. \u201cFor working families,\u201d he said, \u201cthat\u2019s next to impossible.\u201d\n\nPlus, increasing mortgage interest rates, which drive up monthly costs, don\u2019t help. Last week, rates fora 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose above 7 percentfor the first time since May, according toFreddie Mac, the federally backed mortgage finance giant.\n\nSonu Mittal, senior vice president and head of the single-family acquisitions division at Freddie Mac, said that outside of high prices and interest rates, which consumers can\u2019t control, raising a down payment \u201ccontinues to be the No. 1 barrier to homeownership.\u201d\n\nBut down-payment assistance options can help buyers come up with the necessary cash. When combined with loan programs that allow buyers to put less money down \u2014 as little as 3 percent of the home\u2019s purchase price, in some cases \u2014 the help can make buying a home a reality.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible in some cases to put no money down. Two federal government programs offer zero percent down-payment loans to borrowers who meet specific criteria. The Department of Veterans Affairs offers full financing for veterans and those on active military duty, and the Department of Agriculture guarantees zero percent down-payment loans in rural areas.\n\n\u201cTwenty-percent down is a myth,\u201d Kemp said. The typical down payment for first-time buyers in 2024 was 9 percent, according to theNational Association of Realtors. Yet the notion that higher down payments are needed persists. As a result, many people of modest means don\u2019t even consider the notion of owning a home, said Kemp, vice president of programs atActs Housing, a nonprofit that provides financial coaching and other services to help renters become homeowners.\n\nStill, finding the right assistance program isn\u2019t easy.A 2023 report from the Urban Institute,a nonprofit research group, identified more than 1,600 government programs across the country designed to help with down payments. Some are offered by the federal government, others by state housing finance agencies or county and local governments. Community-funded organizations and even commercial lenders may also offer help.\n\nMost, but not all, programs serve first-time buyers, and most set income limits for borrowers \u2014 typically based on the median income in the home\u2019s area. The dizzying assortment of programs, which have varying criteria and geographic restrictions, can make it challenging to identify and apply for available help.\n\n\u201cHome buyers don\u2019t know where to start,\u201d said Ashley Moore, community lending manager withChase Home Lendingin Houston.\n\nSome programs offer grants, which don\u2019t need to be repaid, but most offer help in the form of a low- or no-interest second mortgage, meaning there is additional debt on the home. Payments on the loans, however, are often deferred, meaning you don\u2019t have to start paying them back right away, and the loans may be forgiven if you remain in the home for a certain period of time \u2014 often five years.\nMore on home buyingMore home buyers are asking relatives for down payment helpMedian down payment tops $105k for metro Boston home buyersSpring House Hunt: Why you don\u2019t need 20% down to buy a home\nJung Hyun Choi, principal research associate for the Urban Institute\u2019s housing finance policy center, said borrowers may combine benefits of several different down-payment programs, a practice sometimes called \u201cstacking,\u201d to come up with the necessary funds. But it can take time and effort to find and apply for various programs. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty complicated,\u201d she said, and can drag out the buying process.\n\nGroups like Acts Housing seek to help borrowers identify the right programs and often find that borrowers are eligible for more than one. \u201cWe love to stack,\u201d Kemp said.\n\nActs Housing recently worked with a buyer who was able to get $19,500 in down-payment assistance from a combination of grants from federal and private lenders and a city program, she said. The buyer put down less than $700 out of pocket at closing for a home in Milwaukee.\n\n\u201cGet all the grants you deserve,\u201d Kemp said. \u201cDon\u2019t leave any money on the table.\u201d\n\nThe borrower, Latoya Myrick, 44, who works in community services, said the assistance had enabled her to buy a duplex for about $200,000, realizing a longtime goal of owning her own home. She had tried before, she said, but didn\u2019t have enough for a down payment. She closed on Jan. 6 and will soon move in. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful.\u201d\n\nOther resources are emerging to help home buyers find down-payment assistance. Freddie Mac in late 2023 began offering a free online search tool,DPA One,to help lenders and housing counselors match eligible borrowers with down-payment help.\n\n\u201cLoan officers may not even know there is a program available,\u201d Mittal said. \u201cWe want to make sure we don\u2019t miss those opportunities.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to say how many homes have been purchased because of the new offering, Mittal said, but the tool is gaining traction. About 7,000 loan officers use the tool, which now has information on about 800 programs across 50 states and the District of Columbia. (Home buyers can try DPA One, but it\u2019s mainly intended for professionals.)\n\nAnother option isDown Payment Resource, an online search tool. Borrowers enter details about themselves and the type of home they want and can get information about programs for which they may be eligible.\n\nYou can also contact your state housing finance authority or work with a housing counseling agency certified by the federalDepartment of Housing and Urban Developmentto learn about available programs. You can search on the HUD website for agencies in your area.\n\n\nWill using a down-payment assistance program cause the interest rate on my loan to be higher?\n\nSome predatory lenders may charge a higher rate to borrowers using assistance programs, Kemp said. When that happens, counselors at certified housing agencies can work with buyers to find lenders who won\u2019t penalize borrowers using down-payment help, she said.\n\nCan I use a family gift to help with a down payment?\n\nLenders may allow gifts from close family members to be included as part of a down payment. In 2024, 8 percent of homebuyers (and 21 percent of first-time buyers) said they had used a gift from a relative or friend, according to the National Association of Realtors. You may need to provide a letter signed by the donor to document that the money doesn\u2019t need to be repaid, according to credit bureauExperian.\n\nDo private lenders offer assistance with down payments?\n\nSome do. Chase, for instance, offers grants of up to $7,500 in eligible areas, including federally identified neighborhoods with majority Black, Hispanic, or Latino populations, that can be used toward a down payment or to reduce a home loan\u2019s interest rate or closing costs.

The price? $7,495,000.\nThe legendary actress,who died in 1969, rented the home while her daughter,Liza Minnelli, performed at theCape Cod Melody Tent. Minnelli also worked as an assistant at the legendary venue as a teen, where she was responsible for changing scenery, the startold the Cape Cod Timesin 2007.\n\u201cIt was funny because Judy called my grandfather one day, less than a day before Liza was performing, and said: \u2018Bill, my daughter is very nervous.

In the foyer, hardwood floors and a blue-carpeted staircase greet you.\nTo the right, you\u2019ll find a 244-square-foot sitting room with three windows and a fireplace that\u2019s boarded.\nTo the left is the living room, a 580-square-foot space with white beamed ceilings and a stone fireplace. Across the room, a bay window offers a sunny spot on a built-in seat. The living room flows naturally into the 277-square-foot dining room, where dark beamed ceilings run overhead and a set of doors leads back out to the porch, the perfect place for taking in the sunset after dinner.\nStep through a door to the bright eat-in kitchen (329 square feet), where a small room to the left serves as a pantry and laundry area. In the kitchen, you\u2019ll find stainless steel appliances and natural stone countertops surrounded by white cabinetry. There\u2019s a double window over the sink.\nA second door offers direct access to the foyer, while a third door reveals a roomy, but unheated, back hallway that continues into a utility and storage room (477 square feet). A half bath completes this level. Only two of these bedrooms are included in the overall bedroom count.\nThe hallway also provides access to a back staircase you can take to four bedrooms and a full bath with a claw-foot tub. This part of the home is not heated.\nBack in the main portion of the home, the main staircase ascends to a bedroom level that holds the primary suite, four other bedrooms ranging from 178 to 268 square feet, and three full bathrooms.\nIn the primary bedroom, expansive windows provide views of the water hitting the beach from the 432-square-foot room. \u00a0Blue carpeting runs throughout the space, which has double closets.

        "content": "ByBeth Treffeisen\nAfter six years of fighting, residents of the Fairlawn Estates in Mattapan can breathe a sigh of relief: their market-rate homes will permanently become affordable.\n\u201cBy securing these homes as permanently affordable, we are continuing our efforts to make Boston a home for everyone and ensuring that families can continue to live and thrive in their neighborhood without the fear of being priced out,\u201d Mayor Michelle Wu said in a statement.\nIn anannouncementon Monday, the city said it invested $10 million from the American Rescue Plan Act to support Related Beal\u2019s acquisition of the Fairlawn Estates, permanently converting the housing to affordable homes.\nThe investment is also part of the city\u2019sAcquisition Opportunity Program, which helps developers buy and preserve existing affordable housing.\nThe acquisition was possible through city funds, private investment, and loans. The newly created Boston Acquisition Fund provided a nearly $1 million commitment.\nThe Fairlawn Estates comprises 12 apartment buildings and a leasing office on Fairlawn Avenue, Cummins Highway, and Bismarck Street.\nThe release said the Flatley Companies constructed the complex in the 1960s, and it was known for its affordability. However, in 2018, that all changed when the long-awaited commuter rail stop opened across from the apartment complex. The building was sold to an investor group, and the property was rebranded as SoMa at the T. Residents faced increased rents, which resulted in evictions.\nThe new owner, Related Affordable, an affiliate of Related Beal, has committed to permanently restricting all 347 units to affordable housing.\n\u201cAffordable housing is core to Related\u2019s DNA, and we are thrilled to provide a more sustainable living solution in such an important, transit-oriented location in Mattapan,\u201d said Kimberly Sherman Stamler, president of Related Beal.\nThe release said Related Affordable plans to invest $6.4 million in immediate repairs and building upgrades, including roof replacements, balcony repairs, and appliance upgrades in all apartments. Related Affordable will also focus on making the buildings more energy efficient.\nThe investment will ensure that half the apartments are for households earning no more than 60% of the Area Median Income, while the other half are for those earning no more than 80%.\nThe agreement with Related also limits rent increases to no more than 2% per year and provides ongoing support for households with housing vouchers.\nThe conversion to affordable housing follows years of advocacy and organizing by Fairlawn tenants, City Life/Vida Urbana, and neighbors in Mattapan.\n\u201cThe constant stress of facing huge rent increases and eviction weighed on us every day over the past six years, and it wasn\u2019t right \u2014 but we want people to know that housing is a human right and we can win the homes we deserve,\u201d said Betty Lewis, of the Fairlawn Tenant Association. \u201cThis is a community victory won by neighbors working together.\u201d\nBeth Treffeisen is a general assignment reporter for Boston.com, focusing on local news, crime, and business in the New England region.\nGet everything you need to know to start your day, delivered right to your inbox every morning.\n\n\u00a92025 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

        "content": "ByCameron Sperance\n\nBaby boomers own a significant chunk of the housing stock in Massachusetts. Don\u2019t count on that changing to solve the housing shortages anytime soon.\n\nBaby boomers \u2014 those from age 58 to 76 \u2014 accounted for nearly 39 percent of the homeowner pool statewide in 2023, according to Redfin\u2019s most recent data.\n\nNationwide, about 21 million homes are \u201cempty nests\u201d \u2014 those with at least three bedrooms and occupied by residents 55 and up with no children at home,according to Zillow.That has the potential to more than make up for the estimated 4.5 million unit national home shortage.\n\nBut for all the talk of a pending \u201csilver tsunami\u201d of generational wealth \u2014 and housing \u2014 transfer to younger demographics, experts caution this won\u2019t be a flash flood of supply.\n\n\u201cA lot of people in our industry have been thinking about this idea that there would be maybe a big wealth transfer, that maybe there would be a lot of baby boomers [with homes] coming on the market at some point,\u201d saidOrphe Divounguy, senior economist at Zillow. \u201cBut unfortunately, our research shows that there\u2019s just not enough of those older families.\u201d\n\nBaby boomers also are staying in their homes longer than ever, meaning you likely shouldn\u2019t expect a sudden jolt of new supply:40 percent of American baby boomershave lived in their current homes for at least 20 years, according to Redfin.\n\nRedfin also noted empty-nest baby boomers owned 25 percent of large homes (those with at least three bedrooms) in Greater Boston in 2022 \u2014 compared to millennials with children owning just 12.5 percent of the supply.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s keeping these older homeowners parked in their current abodes rather than downsizing? Money talks, but the high cost of moving \u2014 especially when it pertains to higher mortgage rates compared to what they might have on their existing homes \u2014 has caused many to decide not to leave their longtime homes.\n\nSeventy-eight percent of baby boomersnationally planned to age in place, an increasingly standard plan for older homeowners, according to Redfin.\n\nEmpty nests would need to be more concentrated in markets with the largest housing shortages \u2014 like Greater Boston \u2014 to make a dent in home prices. But that isn\u2019t the case.\n\nIn the local market, Zillow notes there are 281,773 empty nests, or about 14 percent of the local housing supply. That\u2019s slightly less than the 16 percent national average of empty nests found coast to coast.\n\n\u201cBoston is a younger place, and there\u2019s just not enough of these older homes available, even if all of them came on the market someday,\u201d Divounguy said.\n\nIt\u2019s not just empty nesters occupying larger homes that\u2019s driving some of the supply shortage.\n\n\u201cMany baby boomers have had very prosperous careers, and that has led to many of them owning multiple properties, whether it be that they own a primary residence and secondary for vacationing, or perhaps a primary and then also in owning investment properties as part of their portfolio,\u201d saidSarah Gustafson, president of theMassachusetts Association of Realtors. \u201cWith that, they\u2019re taking up so much of that available inventory, it\u2019s exacerbating the housing shortage that we\u2019ve seen over the past couple of years.\u201d\n\nMany older homeowners just prefer to stay where they are.\n\n\u201cThe most common reasons [for baby boomers deciding to age in place] are that people like where they live and that there is no good alternative for them,\u201d saidChen Zhao, economics research lead at Redfin. \u201cThat\u2019s really what it boils down to.\u201d\n\nThink of the pending generational wealth and housing supply transfer more like a trickle than a tsunami, according to the Redfin team. Higher mortgage rates and home prices increase the supply shortage in a market like Greater Boston.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long while coming,\u201d Zhao said. \u201cBoston has probably one of the tighter home markets and is one of the places where it seems like the market is frozen.\u201d\n\nThere are a mix of policy levers a region like Greater Boston can pull to help younger generations with housing accessibility and affordability. Governor Maura Healey\u2019sUnlocking Housing Production Commissionexamined the state\u2019s housing shortage and notedsingle-family-only zoning is a key obstacle, blocking more housing construction.\n\nThe commission recommended eliminating single-family zoning across the state in a move that wouldn\u2019t ban single-family homes from being constructed. Instead, the measure would prohibit municipal governments from blocking many multi-unit housing proposals on residential lots.\n\n\u201cThe solution is not to wait and hope for existing homes to come on the market. It\u2019s to help the builders build more housing,\u201d Zillow\u2019s Divounguy said. \u201cBoston happens to be one of the more restrictive markets in terms of building restrictions. It means loosening some of these building restrictions in the metro area and allowing for more construction.\u201d\n\nThere also are much longer-term solutions to some of the housing shortage. Baby boomers and millennials are larger generations, and that presents a multigenerational need for housing.\n\nBut declining birth rates in the US and expected lower immigration rates also can mean decreased housing demand in the distant future \u2014 emphasis on distant.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s going to happen immediately, but at some point this does make a difference for housing demand and our housing shortage,\u201d Zhao said.\nAddress NewsletterOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.Submit your emailEnter your email addressSign up\nOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.\n\n\u00a92025 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

        "content": "ByMegan Johnson\nTaylor Halldeparted theBruinsfor theChicago Blackhawksback in 2023, but the hockey player\u2019s Fort Point condo is up for grabs. The four-bedroom, 3.5-bath unit is listed for $4,099,000.\nBuilt at the turn of the last century, 355 Congress St. was originally known asTremont Electric Lighting Co.At the time, you would find the company\u2019s machine shop on the first floor, where they built electric meters and motors. The lamp department was on the second floor, according to historical documents. (These days, the brick beauty of a building is better known as the home ofLucky\u2019s Lounge.)\nDespite its historic bona fides,Unit 601exudes a modern sensibility.\nStep inside the building\u2019s secure entrance, equipped with aButterflyMXaccess-control system. Steps head up to the lobby floor, where you\u2019ll find the mailroom to the left. Take the historic elevator to the fifth floor.\nThe foyer is on the bedroom level. Closets on both sides await your boots, coats, and hockey bag. Tired from pond skating? There\u2019s a bedroom straight ahead. The nearly 114-square-foot space does not have a closet but could easily function as a home office or den.\nBack in the hallway, there\u2019s a glass staircase on the left and a long hallway that features utilities, storage, and laundry. There\u2019s also a full bathroom with a tub and access to a 193-square-foot bedroom that boasts stunning views of the brick-filled neighborhood. Next door to that is a slightly bigger bedroom (198 square feet) that features double-door closets and beautiful views of the neighborhood and Farnsworth Street. The en-suite bath has a glass-enclosed shower and an entrance from the hallway.\nClimb the glass staircase to the living level, which offers 13-foot ceilings and an open floor plan that the staircase cuts in half. A few steps down, and you\u2019re in the 593-square-foot living room. Grab a seat around the fireplace, which is surrounded by Carrara marble and has wood features above it around a built-in television. Floating shelves sit on the left and right, while a bar area with refrigerated drawers is ready for you to stock up for entertaining.\n\u201cYou can see the Fort Point sign from the living room window,\u201d\u00a0 saidAmy Carlisle, lead\u00a0of The Carlisle Group at Compass, who has thelisting. \u201cIt\u2019s such a pretty view.\u201d\nFrom the living room, a door opens to a long, narrow deck. That deck lines the outside of the condo and leads to the 1,022-square-foot main deck, with direct access to the 200-square-foot primary bedroom suite. The suite\u2019s 86-square-foot walk-through closet comes with built-ins and ushers you through to a stunning primary bath that\u2019s home to dual vanities, a shower, and a motorized toilet.\nThe dining room (134 square feet) is also off the hallway. It features sliding doors that open out to the main deck. The dining area is off the 320-square-foot kitchen, which has an integrated refrigerator and high-gloss white cabinets. A gray stone island anchors the space, which has same pale hardwood flooring that runs throughout the home. There\u2019s also a half bathroom off that room.\nClimb the glass stairs up another flight to the condo\u2019s beautiful roof deck, which faces the harbor. The 315-square-foot space offers views that stretch into the Financial District.\nThe condo, which a developer transformed in 2018, has a $677 monthly homeowners association fee. It comes with a parking spot behind the building. A second parking spot is available for rent at the Farnsworth Garage for $500 a month. The building allows pets, according to the write-up on the Multiple Listing Service.\nGet the latest news on buying, selling, renting, home design, and more.\n\n\u00a92025 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

        "content": "By ANDRE MUGGIATI, Associated Press\n\nWELLFLEET, Mass. (AP) \u2014A luxury home that had been on the verge of tumbling into Cape Cod Baydue to erosion has been demolished.\n\nA potential collapse of the 5,100-square-foot home threatened oyster beds in nearby Wellfleet Harbor, but a dispute over its removal had left it teetering on the edge of a sandy bluff for months. But on Monday, heavy machinery rolled in to remove the house piece by piece, with trucks carrying it away. By Tuesday, only its concrete slab, chimney and a generator remained.\n\n\u201cOn one side, it is sad because it was a beautiful house that became a landmark in that place,\u201d said John Cobler, a member of the Wellfleet Environmental Commission. \u201cOn the other, I am happy that it is gone. It is a great relief for our town and for our environment.\u201d\nA luxury house is close to tumbling into Cape Cod Bay. Will anyone stop it?\nCobler said attorneys for owner John Bonomi filed a request with the town last week to remove the house. An attorney for Bonomi declined to comment to The Associated Press.\n\nThe house was built in 2010 on the bay side of the Cape Cod peninsula. Its original owners sought permission in 2018 to build a seawall to stave off erosion. The commission rejected the seawall out of concern for unintended effects on the beach and how water carries nutrients in the bay. They also questioned whether it would save the house.\n\nIn 2019, Bonomi, a New York attorney, bought the house for $5.5 million.\n\nMeanwhile, the erosion advanced. A report prepared for Wellfleet last year estimated the house would fall down the bluff within three years, potentially sending debris into a harbor where shellfish farmers grow the town\u2019s namesake oysters, and the environment commission asked Bonomi for a plan to remove the house.\n\nJust a week before the demolition, strong winds battered the cape for three days, exposing more of the home\u2019s concrete pillars.\n\nAn attorney for Bonomi had told the commission at its January meeting that the house had been sold to a salvage company that would not fund removal of the house. But the town\u2019s conservation agent noted at the time that no transfer of deed had been recorded, and a check of records Tuesday also found no record of sale.\nSign up for the Today newsletterGet everything you need to know to start your day, delivered right to your inbox every morning.Submit your emailEnter your email addressSign up\nGet everything you need to know to start your day, delivered right to your inbox every morning.\n\n\u00a92025 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

Ellement, The Boston Globe\n\n639 Corea Road, Gouldsboro, Maine\n\n$799,000\n\nStyleContemporary\n\nYear built1950; updated 2024\n\nSquare feet2,500\n\nBedrooms3\n\nBaths2 full\n\nSewer/WaterPrivate\n\nTaxes$2,874 (2025)\n\nIt\u2019s found on the rugged coastline near the town of Gouldsboro, Maine, and in the backyard there are views ofSchoodic Peninsulaharbor, where commercial fish and lobster boats still sail out to the Gulf of Maine.\n\nWhat we are talking about is pink granite, and large chunks of it are formed into a fire circle in the backyard of this 2,500-square-foot home in a town that boasts five distinct villages and 55 miles of coastline within its boundaries.\n\n\nBut before sharing stories around a backyard fire, take a walk through this 75-year-old home that was fully updated in 2024. From the driveway, walk past the deck overlooking the sloping front yard to reach the front door at the top of three stone steps.\n\nIt opens into the living room that features a black gas fireplace, and the updated white oak engineered hardwood throughout the house. There are views of the town and harbor.\n\n\nTo the left, a central hallway connects to the rest of the rooms on this level. The first to appear is the fully updated kitchen on the left. It\u2019s a study in white, black, and glistening silver.\n\nThe countertops on the large island and the counters are white quartz flecked with gray. The cabinets are white, but the faucet and the island are black. The range is fueled by gas, and the appliances are stainless steel. A slider connects to the backyard, and the ceiling is knotty planks. Beyond the kitchen is a dining area with access to the front deck amid three large double-hung windows.\n\n\nOn the right side of the house is the first full bath, which has a single vanity sink with a quartz top. The shower has a clear glass door with a gray subway tile backsplash.The flooring in both the shower and the bathroom is stone mosaic tile,with radiant heat below the walking space. There is also a large closet and laundry room with space for full-size appliances.\n\n\nCompleting this floor is a large bedroom in the rear of the house.\n\nThe primary bedroom is on the second floor in the left corner of the home, providing scenic views from the double-hung windows on two exterior walls. The interior wall is decorated with white shiplap. The entrance to the bathroom is framed by wood timbers and the door itself is a barn-style slider.\n\n\nThe full bath \u2014 shared with another bedroom \u2014 features a white oval soaking tub and a double vanity with gold faucets, a white quartz countertop, and a Navy blue wood cabinet. The shower is behind gold-framed glass and has a stone mosaic tile floor and a gray tile backsplash. There is a square rain shower head. This bathroom also has radiant heat flooring.\n\n\nOn the other side is another bedroom, now outfitted with a pair of twin beds. There are double-hung windows on two exterior walls.\n\nThe third floor can be used as a rec room, but is currently set up with two twin beds along with four comfortable chairs. The walls have shiplap molding and two windows in the corner look out to the harbor.\n\nThe basement has a dirt floor and storage space.\n\nAccording to the listing agent,Tacy Ridlonof Better Homes & Gardens The Masiello Group in Ellsworth, Maine, Gouldsboro does not restrict rentals in a town where the summer population doubles to about 3,400.\n\nJohn R.

        "content": "ByCameron Sperance\n\nThe Bay State might have the misfortune of being labeled \u201cTaxachusetts,\u201d but experts point to how it\u2019s not as bad as itcouldbe from a property tax standpoint. That distinction goes to New Jersey \u2014 at least this year, anyway.\n\nStill, Massachusettshome buyersshouldn\u2019t be caught off guard by property tax increases, which can add even more financial stress to homeownership.\n\n\u201cOver time, property taxes have inched up, but I think it\u2019s really about how the counties and the state manage their financials,\u201d saidEllen Steinfeld, senior executive vice president of consumer lending and payments at Berkshire Bank.\n\nProperty taxes are what homeowners pay to their city or town based on the assessed value of their home and the municipal tax rate. This tax rate varies by community and largely depends on a municipality\u2019s financial status and spending levels.\n\nIf you average these tax rates,the effective property tax rateacross Massachusetts is 1.14 percent on every assessed dollar \u2014 making Massachusetts the 18th highest of any US state and the District of Columbia, according toRocket Mortgage.\n\nNew Jersey has the highest property tax rates in the country. Illinois, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Connecticut round out the top five, respectively.\n\nPlus,a study the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, in collaboration with the Massachusetts Competitive Partnership and the Donahue Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, released Monday ranked the state 46th (from strongest to weakest) in the nation when it comes to state and local tax collections per capita as a competitive weakness.\nMore Fall House HuntThe fix is in. Shoppers flock to buy homes that need work.All the world\u2019s a stage, so make your home its starThe median home price in Mass. in July was $650k. Here\u2019s what that gets you now.\nRates can vary significantly within the state itself.\n\nAlmost one-third of Massachusetts municipalities have split property tax rates between commercial and residential dwellings, according to thePioneer Institute of Public Policy Research, a maneuver some states use to offset the high cost of housing with a reduced tax burden. This often means municipalities with higher commercial bases can have lower residential taxes.\n\nBucolic Wendell \u2014 with a municipal property tax rate of $22.15 per $1,000 of assessed value \u2014 had the highest rates in the state in fiscal 2024, according to theMassachusetts Department of Revenue. Chilmark on Martha\u2019s Vineyard \u2014 at $2.12 per $1,000 of assessed value \u2014 has the lowest. Some communities like Boston also offer a residential tax exemption that \u201creduces your tax bill by excluding a portion of your residential property\u2019s value from taxation. Last fiscal year, the residential exemption will [have] saved qualified Boston homeowners up to $3,610.53 on their tax bill.\u201d\n\nCommercial and industrial property owners paid 58 percent of all property taxes in 2022 compared to 42 percent of residential property owners, per the Pioneer Institute report. But there is concern this balance could shift more toward residential property owners amid higher vacancy rates in commercial buildings following the pandemic.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot that goes into property taxes, but generally, I don\u2019t see higher property taxes as a bad thing,\u201d saidDaryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin. \u201cThe downside of having property taxes very low is that it makes housing a more appealing financial investment, and then that can crowd out first-time home buyers if investors are buying homes simply because it has favorable taxes.\u201d\n\nFurther, it\u2019s important for homeowners to keep tabs on how frequent towns reassess property values to avoid sticker shock.\n\n\u201cSome municipalities do their assessments frequently, so the changes aren\u2019t as big,\u201d Fairweather said. \u201cSome will do assessments more sporadically, and then people can get pretty big shocks when they go and see how much their home has been reassessed for.\u201d\n\nA reassessment doesn\u2019t have to be the final verdict, however. You can contest an assessment by filing an abatement application with your local tax assessor\u2019s office for potential overvaluation. Further, senior citizens are eligible for property tax credits and exemptions.\n\nMassachusetts has a safeguard against municipalities going overboard with hikes: Proposition 2\u00bd prevents a town from raising the rate more than 2.5 percent a year without a majority override vote.\n\nThere was an expectation coming out of the pandemic thatoverride votes would increase amid rising inflationand dwindling government relief funds to cover budget shortfalls. That appears to be precisely what happened.\n\nProp 2\u00bd override votes are becoming increasingly common: Nearly 100 such votes have taken place in the past 18 months \u2014 the most seen in more than a decade, the Globe\u2019s James Vaznisreported in July. About two-thirds of them were successful.\n\nPerhaps the nickname \u201cTaxachusetts,\u201d at least when it comes to property tax hikes on the horizon, isn\u2019t such an overstatement after all.\n\nSend comments to[email\u00a0protected].\nAddress newsletterGet the latest news on buying, selling, renting, home design, and more.Submit your emailEnter your email addressSign up\nGet the latest news on buying, selling, renting, home design, and more.\n\n\u00a92025 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

It was built in 2001.\nPerched at the beginning of the street behind a fieldstone wall overlooking the Dedham Country & Polo Club, a short flight of steps up to the front door brings guests into the stunning two-story foyer under a sparkling chandelier. Boasting an open floor plan, it features hardwood floors and custom woodwork running throughout the dramatic space.

        "content": "By Ulrich Lorimer, The Boston Globe\n\nThat stubborn, dirt-flecked pile of snow in the shady corner of my garden serves as an unwelcome reminder of the winter season, now only a few weeks from coming to an official end. Sunshine and warmer temperatures this past week have lifted my spirits nearly as much as seeing the first of the blooming snowdrops I planted last year push through the earth. Students of nature will have observed the buds swelling on trees and shrubs, while the bud scales of early blooming willows shyly reveal their silvery, furry flower buds underneath.\n\nWe are on the cusp of spring returning to New England. Gardeners recognize the invigorating energy, the drive to return outside that spring awakens within us. Whether you have started seeds in your basement, greenhouse, or kitchen, the excitement is palpable.\n\nMy thoughts now turn to bed preparation, clean up of winter debris, and cutbacks of last year\u2019s stems. Here are a few things to consider as you get ready for spring cleanup.\n\nLeaving stems standing over winter has loads of benefits, from protecting the crown of the plant, providing habitat and nesting for bees and other wildlife, as well as extending the aesthetic interest of your garden. But now that winter is almost over, when is it safe to cut those stems back? A good rule of thumb is to wait until you observe flying insects in your garden. In our area, that\u2019s usually from late March into early April, depending on the weather trends.\n\nFor mulch, I like to leave as much leaf litter in the beds as possible in the fall while collecting leaves from the lawn into a pile. If I have time and motivation, I may run them over with the lawn mower to chop them smaller. That pile of composting leaves is now a great source to top-dress any sections of planting beds blown bare by winter winds. Smaller pieces are easy to work with around the emerging stems, leaves, and blossoms of spring bulbs and perennials.\n\nFor some tips on bed preparation, let us turn to a reader question:\n\nQ.This spring, I plan to move a 6-foot-long by 3-foot-deep bed of hydrangeas about 4 feet behind their current location. The new location currently is overrun with various wild woodland plants/weeds. The new location is lower than the current bed, and I will fill it with about 3 to 4 feet of new loam. Once transplanted, I will add about 3 inches of mulch.\n\nMy question is: Should I use a herbicide to kill current, unwanted undergrowth before filling with new loam? Will using a herbicide create a risk to the transplanted hydrangeas? Will simply adding 4 to 4 feet of new loam on top of existing wild plants stifle any new growth without applying herbicide?\n\nKevin,Natick\n\nA.The tenets ofintegrated pest management(IPM) teach us to approach pest or weed management in an environmentally sensitive manner. The first step is to observe and learn about your problem. Our reader has identified unwanted plants that may threaten his plans to establish a new bed. Before reaching for the herbicide, let\u2019s consider a few nontoxic solutions that would solve the problem without using chemicals.\n\nThe next step in this scenario would be to consider a physical barrier to smother the unwanted plants. Given the amount of loam planned to be added on top, I would put down a layer of cardboard first before the loam is piled on. While the herbicide might not impact the hydrangeas, it will affect the beneficial life found in the loam. Soil is alive with countless organisms that help break down and repackage organic matter into forms that plants can use. Keeping your soil healthy will keep your garden growing abundantly.\n\nIf you believe the weeds to be especially tenacious, you can escalate the solution to nontoxic herbicides that use active ingredients like vinegar, citric acid, or botanical oils.Arbico Organicsis a great source for these types of products. Organic herbicides are safe to use around people and pets and will not affect the soil kingdom.\n\nAfter exhausting all other alternatives, then and only then, consider turning to chemical herbicides. The IPM approach ensures that we continue to move away from the days of blanket spraying your plants to the use of organic products delivered with very targeted applications using the smallest amount needed. Happy spring, my fellow gardeners, I hope to see you over the garden gate soon!\n\nUlrich Lorimer is the director of horticulture at the Native Plant Trust in Framingham.

There are two double-hung windows on the two exterior walls, hardwood flooring, and an antique period medallion as the central light fixture. The current owner has placed a table with seating for six. On the right side, there is a wide pass-through into the kitchen, and at the end of the room is a custom-built China cabinet that is original to the 145-year-old home.\n\n\nKitchens are considered the heart of the home, and this iteration absolutely qualifies.

There is a large closet and double-hung windows on three exterior walls. The flooring is hardwood.\n\n\nThe second bedroom is 165 square feet and also has a skylight.

        "content": "By Madeline Bilis, The Boston Globe\n\nHouses in New England are a special breed. Plenty of them are more than 100 years old, while others make the most of narrow floor plans on tiny lots. Historic districts, zoning restrictions, and other guardrails can add layers of red tape while renovating or expanding these homes.\n\nTo work around some of these rules, builders and architects have had to get creative \u2014 whether that\u2019s carving out additional storage space from some unused corner or transforming an oddly shaped nook into something more useful. Ahead, find three unique home projects that maximize each home\u2019s nooks and crannies.\n\n\nWhen Rajiv Raman set out to convert the garage of his 1870s Somerville home into another bedroom, he knew he might encounter a few challenges. For one, working within the home\u2019s small footprint would be complex, and removing and adding walls was likely to affect other parts of the house.\n\nThat was the case in Raman\u2019s small kitchen, which needed to be expanded to connect the garage to the main house. The problem? The only wall offering natural light into the space needed to go. \u201cWe knew that we would have to get rid of the bay window in our kitchen, but we didn\u2019t want to just wall it off,\u201d Raman said. \u201cWe wanted to create some other source of light in the kitchen.\u201d\n\nSo he brainstormed with his architect, Patrick Rettig, to find a unique solution: Building a \u201cskylight nook\u201d as an additional lounge area for his two kids, with rows of windows to let sunlight into the kitchen. Now, this 5\u00bd-foot-tall bump-out is a place for the kids to play games, kick back with their Nintendo Switch or iPad, and do homework.\n\nSince the three windows on the wall looked directly out to their neighbor\u2019s roof deck, Raman attached window clings to create a frosted effect for privacy. For added customization, he ordered carpet fragments to cover the back of the built-in bench below the nook.\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also this company on Amazon where you can just send them exact dimensions of very odd-shaped benches, and they\u2019ll custom make a cushion,\u201d he said, so he plopped the custom cushions on the bench to complete the new dining area created by the nook. The built-in bench and accompanying table freed up precious square footage in the kitchen, too.\n\n\u201cNow we have a kitchen you can actually walk around in,\u201d Raman said. \u201cIt really opened up the space by Somerville standards.\u201d\n\n\nRenovation projects located in historic districts naturally come with constraints. For his clients who lived in a half-Cape in Provincetown, Chris Brown, principal and founder ofb Architecture studio, knew the challenge was optimizing the home\u2019s original footprint without expanding it.\n\n\nThe first floor, in particular, was in desperate need of creative storage solutions. To find a place for everyday essentials, Brown modified the home\u2019s central staircase, building full-depth drawers below them for shoes and other mudroom accessories. Two triangular and two rectangular drawers are now equipped with heavy-duty drawer glides, allowing them to hold considerable weight.\n\n\nJust around the corner, the team also built an appliance storage cubby on the remaining underside of the staircase. Each cubby was custom-sized and built to fit both the coffee maker and microwave, effectively preventing them from cluttering the countertops.\n\n\u201cAnd then we still had a little bit of leftover space, and the clients asked \u2018What about a small wine fridge?\u2019\u201d Brown said. He devised a way to squeeze an eight- to 12-bottle wine fridge in the remaining nook. Now, Brown reasoned, the clients can enjoy an ideal use of that space.\n\n\u201cMaybe half of our projects, sometimes more, are dealing with at least some existing conditions, and certainly zoning and square footage constraints,\u201d he said. \u201cWe love doing these types of creative, fun built-ins that let us think a little differently about what that space could be.\u201d\n\n\nWhile expanding their primary bathroom, the owners of a duplex in Charlestown were presented with a small conundrum: They needed to encroach into the floor plan of the adjoining guest bedroom \u2014 unevenly.\n\n\n\u201cIt became an odd footprint,\u201d explained Dennis Duffy, principal ofDuffy Design Group, since the expanded bathroom left an angular \u201chole\u201d in the bottom section of the wall.\n\nAt the same time, Duffy said the clients were keen to have a place where their guests could relax on their own, either to watch TV or read. The solution then materialized: The extra space could be converted into a \u201cpit\u201d for reading and relaxing, as well as additional sleeping space for visiting children. (Later, a TV was installed in the nook.)\n\n\u201c[The clients] loved the solution of the modular \u2018pit,\u2019\u201d Duffy said. They enthusiastically agreed to a graphic treatment off the interior wall, featuring strips of wood and offset disk light fixtures.\n\nAs for what to relax upon, the team selected a layout with cushions inspired byRoche Bobois\u2019s iconicMah Jong collection, a modular sofa that can be converted into countless different shapes.\n\nThe result is a cozy relaxation pit balancing equal parts comfort and style.\n\n\u201cHaving begun my career in New York City, I\u2019m used to working with small spaces,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cI learned early on to try to find the best functional solutions for spaces like this, as long as it stays on message with the concept and adds functionality.\u201d\nAddress NewsletterOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.Submit your emailEnter your email addressSign up\nOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.\n\n\u00a92025 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

        "content": "ByMegan Johnson\nAnyone who has ever taken a field trip to Salem will recognize the name tied to 252 Essex Street in Beverly, which is currently on the market for $600,000.\nGiles Corey, a farmer accused of witchcraft during the Salem witch trials, pleaded \u201cnot guilty.\u201d He didn\u2019t believe he\u2019d achieve a fair trial and refused to speak. He was subsequently sentenced to death by pressing\u00a0and became one of the most notable figures from the witch trials with the phrase he repeated as he died: \u201cMore weight.\u201d According to legend, that\u2019s what Corey repeatedly said to his executioners as they added more stones on top of him. (He was also written as a character in Arthur Miller\u2019sThe Crucible.)\nThe four-bed, two-bath property, which was first built in 1675 and underwent a variety of transformations over the years,\u00a0belonged to William Cleaves, who was Corey\u2019s son-in-law.\nSet on .79 of an acre, the 2,315-square-foot home looks almost plucked out of Corey\u2019s era thanks to everything from the wide-plank pine floors to the well in the basement (don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s on city water now).\nA few steps up, on the right side of the home, under a small porch, brings you into an 184-square-foot kitchen, the first space built in the home. It features green tile floors, an operational 1930s stove, and a walk-in pantry. There\u2019s also a door to an additional staircase to the second story. Next door is the second dining room, a 222-square-foot space featuring wood floors and a ceiling with beams that resemble logs. The remnants of a chimney stack sit in the corner. A 267-square-foot living room has wide plank floors and a fireplace that should be inspected before use. Two windows overlook the stunning gardens and street. A green door to the right of the fireplace leads to the downstairs bathroom, which features a shower. A door to the left of the fireplace moves into the foyer, home to the main entrance of the home.\nContinue through to the second dining room, a charming 241-square-foot space with a built-in hutch, beamed ceiling, and easy access to the back patio through a door. The main kitchen, a 169-square-foot space, is next door and has a washer/dryer that\u2019s included in the sale, track lighting overhead, and a door to the other front porch. A French door leads into a pantry, while a thinner French door leads to a mini pantry. Another door leads to the back patio.\nHead back into the foyer to access the main staircase to the second story, where you\u2019ll find each of the four bedrooms. The top of the staircase is also home to the second full bathroom, which has a tub. A bonus room measuring 239 square feet is a great addition to the second story, and a walk-up attic provides extra storage space.\nThe home features a fieldstone and dirt basement. There is also a separate 1-car garage that measures 344 square feet, as well as a storage space that measures 121 square feet.\nThe home\u2019s outdoor spaces are some of its greatest features. The backyard, which is partially protected by conservation restrictions, is filled with trees, giant rocks, and a treehouse. The front yard is home to beautiful gardens, where wisteria hangs, and garden plots outlined by stone are frequently noticed by passersby.\n\u201cThe gardens are something that almost everybody knows,\u201d saysDiantha Phosithanof Engel & V\u00f6lkers By the Sea, who has thelisting.\nThe home will need a new roof \u201cpretty much right away.\u201d\nOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.\n\n\u00a92025 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

        "subhead": "A year after a landmark settlement called for a disruption in how real estate agents are paid, people say they still feel forced to pay them excessive commissions.",
        "content": "By Debra Kamin, New York Times Service\n\nWhen Mike Chambers was ready to sell his house in Boulder, Colorado, last month, he interviewed a handful of real estate agents who promised he could fetch $2.75 million or more if he listed with them.\n\nBut the promise would come at a cost: Each agent wanted him to pay a commission of at least 5%, or $137,500.\n\nFrustrated that not a single agent was willing to budge on the rate, Chambers, 39, decided to sell his house on his own, and he took to social media with the handle @realtorshateme to chronicle the process. His reels drew 50,000 views or more.\n\nWithin days, local agents were making their own social media posts that countered his points \u2014 an action Chambers described as an aggressive campaign aimed at preventing him from making a sale on his own.\n\nCall it the Realtor recoil.\n\nOne year after theNational Association of Realtors agreed, as part of a legal settlement, to change a key rule on real estate commissions \u2014 a rule that had long uphelda tradition of commissionsbetween 5% and 6%, little has changed.\n\nWhat was hailed as a watershed has so far produced a mere drizzle.\n\nSome economists predicted the rule change would upend the business model and bring competition to a long-stilted marketplace, breaking the standard 6% rate \u2014 one of the highest rates in the world \u2014 and forcing down home prices as a result.\n\nThough average commissions appear to be slipping, industry watchdogs say that Realtors and their brokerages have used workarounds and pressure on sellers like Chambers to subvert the settlement. So far, they\u2019re finding success.\n\n\u201cThe industry understood the threat to 5 or 6% rates right away, so looked for opportunities to discourage negotiation,\u201d said Stephen Brobeck, a senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based Consumer Policy Center, who has been vocal about the need for greater consumer awareness in the real estate industry.\n\nReal estate commissions in the United States have long been baked into a home\u2019s listing price and then paid by the seller to their agent. The agent would then split that payout with the agent who brought a buyer, usually with 2.5% to 3% for each.\n\nThe rate of the commission split was communicated on private listing databases available only to agents, called multiple listing services, and in the lawsuit that led to the settlement,a group of home sellers in Missouriargued that the covert sharing of rates led to a lack of transparency about whom, and how much, home sellers were required to pay. They also argued it inflated fees.\n\nA jury agreed, and NAR and the brokerages were ordered to pay nearly $2 billion in damages. The settlement came five months later, with the NAR agreement to end the practice of commission-sharing over MLS databases as part of the deal. NAR also agreed to pay$418 million to settle the claims, and some brokerages separately settled for millions of dollars.\n\nAfter a six-month reprieve, the NAR rule changebecame official in August 2024. Average commissions dropped from 5.64% to 4.96% in the months that followed, which means a drop in commission of $2,870 on a median-priced home, according to a survey of 1,300 agents conducted by RISMedia, a real estate media company. (Two other studies, conducted by the online brokerage Redfin and the cloud-based real estate accounting firm AccountTech, found commissions have not changed, but those results could be considered biased because both organizations have a stake in the results.)\n\n\u201cThe system has been in place for 100 years. It\u2019s not going to change overnight,\u201d said Michael Ketchmark, the lawyer who represented the Missouri homeowners. \u201cIt\u2019s not like one day we started streaming movies and then Blockbuster video stores were suddenly gone. It was a slow progressive change in technology and that\u2019s what we\u2019re witnessing here.\u201d\n\nMany agents say that since the settlement, they\u2019ve felt cornered by buyers and sellers alike to defend their value. Jeremy Larsen, a Realtor in Dallas, said that consumers who decide to navigate the home market without an agent are taking huge risks with their money.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like walking into a courtroom without an attorney. Why would you do that? There\u2019s so many possible things that can go wrong,\u201d he said.\n\nOne viral Instagram video, created last month by a Realtor in Fresno, California, with 114,000 followers, shows a man driving down a suburban cul-de-sac and encountering a seller\u2019s agent standing outside a house for sale with a sign that reads \u201c0 percent\u201d \u2014 referring to the amount of commissions the sellers were willing to pay any agent who brought a buyer.\n\n\u201cHell, no,\u201d the narrator says.\n\nAt the house next door, also for sale, an agent holds a sign that reads \u201c3 percent.\u201d The man pulls over and says he\u2019d like to take a look.\n\nThe video may have been a joke, but its message was clear: Many agents, now banned from making offers of commission to each other on private Realtor-only databases, are not adapting to the intent of the settlement. Rather than encouraging buyers to now negotiate rates on their own, they continue to press sellers to offer commissions of 5% 6%, and then discuss commission splits among themselves.\n\nThose commission splits are largely happening the old-fashioned way: phone, email and text. In one TikTok video viewed by The New York Times, a real estate coach in Virginia with 60,000 followers, trains her viewers on how to build a landing page for each of her listings that sends automated messages to buyers\u2019 agents informing them of the commission they will receive if they bring a buyer.\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\n\u201cIt only took a matter of weeks really, for most agents to find a loophole. It\u2019s almost a joke,\u201d said Nick Aufenkamp, a Realtor in Washington who started a coaching business, DIY Homebuyer Academy, after the settlement to help buyers learn how to represent themselves in real estate transactions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge reluctance to see any change in this industry,\u201d Aufenkamp said. He estimates he has coached 30 clients who wanted to represent themselves in a home purchase and ran into a wall.\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nThe National Association of Realtors \u201cis resolutely opposed to any attempt to circumvent the settlement,\u201d said a spokesperson, Troy Green, who added that any attempts from agents to influence buyers\u2019 or sellers\u2019 decisions in order to gain more commission \u201cis unequivocally not something that NAR condones.\u201d The organization has a fact sheet on its website explaining that steering is a violation of their code of ethics.\n\nBut Green added that the settlement \u201cexpressly allows\u201d agents to communicate offers of commission between each other on venues outside of the MLS databases.\n\nAnd there lies the rub, said Doug Miller, a Minnesota lawyer who five years ago brought one of the first lawsuits over inflated commissions to Cohen Milstein, a Chicago law firm.\n\n\u201cThe NAR settlement solves MLS steering. It did not solve steering,\u201d he said. \u201cSharing is caring. Unless you\u2019re a Realtor, and then it\u2019s collusion.\u201d\n\n(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)\n\nSome agents have turned to the legislative process to protect commission sharing. A few months after NAR lost its lawsuit, Oklahoma state Sen. Paul Rosino, a former broker, co-sponsored a bill requiring agents on both sides of a transaction to share their fees in writing. With the support of Oklahoma\u2019s influential Realtor association, that bill passed, and went into effect, in May.\n\nThe New York Times interviewed 15 buyers and sellers across the country, from Colorado to Ohio to Arizona and beyond, who said they were blocked out of the market when they tried to negotiate commissions, or navigate transactions without a real estate agent.\n\nIn Boulder, Chambers\u2019 home listing caught the eye of a local real estate agent, Lindsay Alfano. Alfano, 25, has been an agent for two years. She said Chambers had promised to pay a buyer\u2019s agent commission, and she told fellow agents at her brokerage, eXp, that she was planning to show the house to her buyers.\n\nShe received text messages mocking her and encouraging her to change course. The Times reviewed the messages.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re working for free,\u201d one colleague said.\n\n\u201cSell your own listings,\u201d another wrote. \u201cThis is embarrassing.\u201d\n\nAlfano described her peers\u2019 reaction as eye-opening. \u201cThe amount of people that were so scared of this guy having access to what we do was a rude awakening for me,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cThe word is steering. If you\u2019re worried how much you\u2019re going to get paid based on the home that your client loves, you\u2019re doing it for the wrong reasons.\u201d\n\nChambers found a buyer in early March and his home is now under contract. He is now focused, he said, on building a new company that he says \u201cwill disrupt the real estate industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted to pay someone for their services, of course, but I don\u2019t want to just light money on fire because there\u2019s a system that\u2019s forcing me to,\u201d he said.\n\nThis article originally appeared inThe New York Times.\n\nBe civil.

        "content": "By Mark Philben, The Boston Globe\n\nQ.Our next door neighbors recently installed a Mitsubishi heat pump system. We love the idea of heat pumps and have strongly considered installing one ourselves. However, our sleep at night and peace during the day have been destroyed ever since they started using their heat pump. Our house is getting hit with heavy, low frequency sound/vibrations. It sounds like a train or giant truck idling beside one\u2019s ear and sometimes the sound waves seem to harmonize to such a point that a long, almost groaning, vibratory pulse is heard and felt. The owners themselves do not seem to be effected, but the three fan/compressor units all face our house directly and everything is built on rock here. We suspect that the sound and vibrations are being transferred through the rock and resonating with our own home construction materials. Certain weather and atmospheric conditions seem to amplify and significantly worsen the sound. Have you heard of or experienced this issue and, if so, do you have any suggestions?\n\n\u2014\u00a0MICHELLE\n\nA.This is a tough one. There are a lot of opinions out there given that conditions vary from installation to installation. We have not encountered this problem yet. A few suggestions:\n\nSince many low-frequency noises are associated with vibrations, the easiest first pass would be to ask your neighbors to place vibration-dampening pads under the unit. That could help somewhat.\n\nOur HVAC company said that it is possible to have the fan blades changed to a more aerodynamic model/material. This is the most likely culprit, but is likely to be a costly fix.\n\nAnother option is to have a roof built over the units. We have done that before in certain instances, given that these heat pumps need to be kept clear of snow in the winter to operate properly. Your neighbors could insulate the roof frame with sound-deadening insulation like rock wool. If so, this could mitigate some of the low-frequency noise.\n\nQ.We have a wood stove inserted into our fireplace. We were told to have our chimney cleaned every four cords of wood. That is very different from your advice (How often should you have your chimney swept?, Jan. 19). Also my husband was diagnosed with a pulmonary disorder, so we are being more conscious of particulates in the air that would irritate his lungs. What are your thoughts on both of these?\n\n\u2014 SARAH\n\nA.I would not advise waiting until you burn four full cords of wood to clean your chimney. Especially if there is some soft woods like pine or spruce mixed in with your hardwoods. Soft woods leave far more creosote buildup than hardwoods like oak and maple. One of the reasons we suggest yearly cleaning for people who burn wood regularly is because it gets a professional\u2019s eye on your whole chimney. They clean it, inspect for animal infiltration, check the masonry, etc. It\u2019s like having a quality mechanic regularly looking under the hood of your car.\n\nGiven that a family member has pulmonary concerns, I think you should be extra vigilant. The smoke from wood-burning fires is particularly hazardous if not contained. It may seem natural and nontoxic, but the particulates emitted can get deep into the lungs.\n\nSomething to consider is an exhaust fan at the top of the chimney that mechanically draws the smoke up through the flue. We have used them when we were worried about how well a chimney would draft. Another less expensive option would be to have an air cleaner in the room taking care of any smoke that may escape from the smoke chamber.\n\nMark Philben is the project development manager atCharlie Allen Renovationsin Cambridge.

        "content": "ByBeth Treffeisen\nWant to park in the heart of Beacon Hill? It\u2019ll cost you \u2014 $750,000, to be exact.\nA coveted spot in the Brimmer Street Garage is now up for sale, offering a rare chance to own a piece of prime city real estate.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pure luxury purchase,\u201d said Rene Rodriguez, the senior vice president of Cabot and Company, the listing agency. \u201cIt\u2019s not for everybody. It\u2019s not like everyone can go shopping at Hermes or take private jet travel.\u201d\n\u201cBut I get it though, because it is outrageous to a certain extent,\u201d Rodriguez continued. \u201cBut, if you have the money to do it, it\u2019s very convenient.\u201d\nLast year, thegarage had three to four transfers, with the highest-priced spot selling for around $565,000. However, several transfers were for only $1 because they were tacked onto a house sale, making it difficult to determine their market value.\nOften, owners sell the spaces privately, so when they do go to market, \u201cthey always create a splash,\u201d said Rodriguez.\nRodriguez said that private transactions sometimes leave money on the table. In this case, the sellers of the parking spot decided to see what they could get on the market.\nMany of the homes on Beacon Hill lack parking spaces, leaving residents with few options for covered, off-street parking, creating a competitive market.\nThe price of parking at the Brimmer Street garage has consistently increased year over year. Rodriguez said the spots first came on the market in the 1970s, and they were going for $7,500 per spot.\n\u201cBut a lot has changed since then,\u201d Rodriguez said.\nHousing prices have also dramatically increased, with many places going for millions \u2014 often without parking.\nRodriguez noted that at those costs, what\u2019s another $750,000 for the convenience of having a parking spot? Plus, it would increase the home\u2019s resale value.\nThe buyer does get some perks. In addition to being a place to park a car, the parking is all valet, it has a filling and charging station, and attended staff can wash the car.\nBut there are ongoing costs beyond buying the deeded spot itself. HOA fees apply, and because the spots are categorized as individual condominiums, they incur additional taxes. Altogether, Rodriguez said it\u2019s about $900 a month.\nBut if you\u2019re not lucky enough to snag a spot at the Brimmer Street Garage, there are the LAZ Charles Street Garage and the Boston Common garages nearby. But both are public, with no valet, and you\u2019ve got to compete with other drivers for limited spaces.\nOr, one can look for street parking.\nEither way, \u201cthe Brimmer Street garage is in a better location,\u201d said Rodriguez. \u201cIt\u2019s a much more exclusive, private parking situation.\u201d\nBeth Treffeisen is a general assignment reporter for Boston.com, focusing on local news, crime, and business in the New England region.\nGet everything you need to know to start your day, delivered right to your inbox every morning.\n\nBe civil.

The city and the soccer team dispute those claims, and so far two judges have ruled in their favor, including one that has allowed demolition to proceed ahead of the start of the trial on Tuesday in Suffolk Superior Court. That case could determine the fate of the $200 million White Stadium project.Related: On eve of White Stadium legal battle, judge\u2019s ruling deals significant blow to plaintiffs\u2019 hopes of stopping projectAdvertisementThe conservancy\u2019s legal campaign has confounded many in Boston\u2019s civic and nonprofit worlds. Since its founding nearly three decades ago, the group has worked closely with City Hall to maintain parkland, a partnership that allows the nonprofit to use the city-owned James Michael Curley mansion on the Jamaicaway as its headquarters for $1 a year. Now they\u2019re at war.\u201cI just feel the conservancy has lost its way,\u201d said Julie Crockford, who served as its president from 2007 to 2015 and notes the organization \u201ccan\u2019t mow a blade of grass\u201d without the city\u2019s permission. \u201cI don\u2019t understand the attitude over the fight. ... I think the voice of cooperation and behind-the-scenes negotiation would have been a stronger hand.\u201dDemolition is underway in preparation for a $200 million redevelopment of White Stadium in Franklin Park.Brett Phelps for The Boston GlobeThat\u2019s typically how nonprofit parks organizations operate. They don\u2019t always see eye to eye with City Hall and may even find themselves on the opposite sides of an issue, but to sue represents an \u201cextreme choice\u201d that risks irreparable damage to the relationship, said Liz Vizza, who recently retired as the longtime president of the Friends of the Public Garden.AdvertisementIn 2016, Vizza was locked in a similarly fierce battle with the city and then-Mayor Marty Walsh over a plan to change state law to allow a proposed skyscraper at the city-owned Winthrop Square Garage, which would cast shadows across Boston Common and the Public Garden.Related: White Stadium project opponents pitch a scaled-down, cheaper alternativeIn that instance, Friends of the Public Garden did not choose to sue but rather duked it out in the court of public opinion. And even though Walsh got his way \u2014 today the 691-foot Winthrop Center by Millennium Partners soars over the Financial District \u2014 Vizza still believes it was the right decision. (Walsh set aside millions of dollars from the sale of the Winthrop garage to invest in the Common and Franklin Park.)\u201cWe knew that if we sued the city ... it would take a generation or more to reestablish a relationship that is vital to working on behalf of these parks,\u201d Vizza said. \u201cSuing would be an extreme choice that we didn\u2019t make because it would have wrecked the relationship.\u201dLeaders of the Emerald Necklace Conservancy, which has never before sued the city, say they did not make this decision lightly, but they felt it was necessary.\u201cWe see this as part of our mission in a way to protect the park,\u201d said Ben Taylor, the conservancy\u2019s longtime chairman and a former publisher of The Boston Globe whose family owned the newspaper for more than a century. \u201cBuilding a professional soccer stadium in Franklin Park is not protecting the park.\u201dRelated: White Stadium project cost has doubled from previous estimates, with city on hook for $91 millionThe conservancy was founded in 1998, conceived to help prevent the kind of flooding of the Muddy River that devastated Kenmore Square in the late 1990s. Since then, it has grown in both staff and scope, helping care for more than 7,000 trees, picking up trash in the parks, sponsoring concerts and artwork, and advocating for parks funding at both the city and state levels. AdvertisementWhile Franklin Park Coalition, a different nonprofit that advocates for Franklin Park and works closely with the conservancy, negotiated with the city for months over concessions for White Stadium, the conservancy seemed intent on throwing up roadblocks, said coalition president Rickie Thompson.The city-owned James Michael Curley House in Jamaica Plain is the headquarters of the Emerald Necklace Conservancy.Brett Phelps for The Boston GlobeHis coalition had concerns over game-day parking and stadium maintenance but hashed things out with the city and ultimately decided to support the project by the time the city signed a lease with the soccer team in December. (Linda Henry, chief executive of Boston Globe Media Partners, has been part of the investor group behind the soccer team but announced last month she is withdrawing from it).With the team aiming to play in 2026, Thompson saw the conservancy\u2019s litigation strategy as a delay tactic tantamount to \u201ckilling the project\u201d and says Boston student-athletes will be the losers.\u201cIt would be fine to slow it down if you had all the time in the world,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cI ran track in high school in White Stadium over 50 years ago, and that stadium has been deteriorating ever since. So we\u2019ve been waiting for 50 years. How much do you want to slow it down? 100 years?\u201dThe first whiff of legal trouble came in January 2024, when the conservancy sent a five-page comment letter to the Boston Landmarks Commission as part of the project review process. The letter, as one City Hall aide put it, \u201cwas written by a lawyer.\u201dAdvertisementCity officials immediately convened a series of meetings with Taylor and conservancy president Karen Mauney-Brodek. There was even a sit down with Wu in her fifth-floor office. The city only learned it was being sued when Globe columnist Adrian Walker called for comment a few weeks later, in February 2024.\u201cI was shocked,\u201d Wu said.Rickie Thompson, president of the Franklin Park Coalition, photographed in 2022.Craig F. Walker/Globe StaffBut looking back, the mayor remembers that meeting in her office with conservancy leaders, and feeling like, even at that early stage, the group didn\u2019t want to engage about solutions to their stated concerns.\u201cIt just felt like they were meeting to check a box,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were trying to work through all of the different concerns that they might have, and I was really in listening mode at that point. The project was very much a concept.\u201dWu said she has found the conservancy\u2019s stance \u201cincredibly disappointing\u201d and that \u201cwe have not and still are not all at the table together.\u201dOne of the driving forces behind the lawsuit is Mauney-Brodek, who has been president of the conservancy since 2016 after working in the parks departments in San Francisco and New York City.Related: BOS Nation doesn\u2019t want to feel like \u2018the baby sister.\u2019 That\u2019s why the team won\u2019t play with the men in Everett. | Shirley LeungWe met up Friday, walking the perimeter of White Stadium as bulldozers whirred and beeped while prepping the grounds for construction. She showed me the young oak trees the conservancy planted nearby and defended the group\u2019s legal action.\u201cThis is not something just to sit back and watch,\u201d Mauney-Brodek said. \u201cWe repeatedly spoke with the Parks Department, wrote letters, met with them, reached out, attempted to find other resolutions. The city had no other ways to go forward.\u201dAdvertisementAnd if anyone feels blindsided, she said, it is the conservancy. When the city, conservancy, and other stakeholders worked on a Franklin Park Action Plan in 2022, the idea of a professional soccer stadium never came up.So far the law has been on the city\u2019s side. Still, Mauney-Brodek is hoping to prevail at the trial.\u201cThis is about the park, and this is about these protections that matter for the city of Boston, for this Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and all of the parks they\u2019re in,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is public land, and that\u2019s the fundamental question here.\u201dOn Tuesday, a judge will begin the process of determining who is right and who is wrong. The lawsuit should be resolved in a week or two. But the divide this case has opened between the city and a parks group could last a lot longer than that.Demolition is underway at White Stadium even as a trial begins Tuesday on a lawsuit challenging the project.Brett Phelps for The Boston GlobeShirley Leung is a Business columnist.

His father funded High Point State Park and helped birth Fox Film, while his grandfather launched Prudential Insurance and served as a US senator.\nKuser, a Princeton grad, made his own mark pushing the eastern goldfinch as New Jersey\u2019s state bird in 1935 \u2014 a win that had senators mocking with fake chirps, per The Ridgewood News.\nAshley Christus of Turpin Real Estate holds the listing.\n\u201cDenbrooke is a timeless gem,\u201d Christus said. \u201cOver the years, it has been the cherished backdrop for family weddings, graduation parties and intimate gatherings alike.\u201d\nSet on 6.6 acres, the home, in Somerset Hills, has been professionally landscaped to include a deer fence, mature specimen trees, expansive level lawns, a perennial garden and an oval swimming pool, the listing notes. Three finished levels house the bedrooms, seven full baths and three powder rooms.\nBut behind the mansion\u2019s grand doors, Astor\u2019s life was crumbling.\nMarried at 17, she later revealed in her memoir \u201cFootprints\u201d about a marriage riddled with booze, alleged affairs and abuse that left her crying herself to sleep.\nAstor toughed it out long enough to oversee a glam overhaul by A-list architect Albert Musgrave Hyde, but by 1930, she was done \u2014 grabbing their son Anthony and filing for divorce in a split that exploded across headlines nationwide.\nKuser\u2019s political career tanked after losing a reelection bid in 1935, and he faded into obscurity, dying in 1964.\nAstor, however, bounced back, marrying Vincent Astor, inheriting a fortune, and becoming a philanthropy juggernaut, earning a Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1998 before passing away at 105 in 2007.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "As the saying goes, a rich man is nothing but a poor man with money \u2014 and real estate.\nMore than 13% of the country\u2019s real estate assets are owned by the wealthiest 1% of Americans \u2014\u00a0a circumstance that significantly enriched the well-heeled over the past two years of sky-high rates and housing shortages. The 1% has been so enriched, a recent Redfin analysis revealed, that their combined wealth could now feasibly purchase almost every home in the nation.\nThe analysis further concluded that the top 0.1% alone could purchase every single home in the country\u2019s 25 most populated metro areas, from New York City to San Antonio.\n\u201cIt is a striking example of the concentration of wealth in America that the top 1% could hypothetically afford to buy every home in the country \u2014 without going into debt \u2014 while millions of households struggle to buy or hold onto just one,\u201d said Chen Zhao, Redfin\u2019s economics research lead, in the report.\nThis stark disparity comes at a time when an outsized percentage of Americans believe that homeownership is no longer a realistic milestone.\nTo gain entry into the 1% club, according to the Federal Reserve, a minimum net worth of $11.2 million is required. An estimated 1.3 million American households claim membership, and their combined net worth totals $49.2 trillion. Real estate helps put this gargantuan number into perspective \u2014 the combined value of 100 million US homes is $49.7 trillion.\nIt\u2019s these two eye-popping measures upon which Redfin based its report, using Federal Reserve data and the estimated value of 98 million US properties. While net worth and aggregate home values are not directly related, the Redfin analysis demonstrated how the two measures have pretty much tracked together for the last 20 years.\nAccording to Redfin, aggregate home values exceeded the 1%\u2019s collective wealth from 2000 until the housing and global financial crisis of 2008. The wealth of the top 1% surpassed home values through the 2010s until a steep drop-off after 2020, when the market disruption of COVID-19 hit the heavily invested portfolios of the rich.\nBut America\u2019s fat cats have clawed their way back. The richest 0.1% of Americans grew their wealth by $4.4 trillion, or 25%, in just two years, Redfin reported.\nIf the 0.1% pooled only that $4.4 trillion earned between 2022 and 2024, they could buy every home in the Chicago, Atlanta, Boston and Houston metro areas, according to Redfin. Their two-year gains exceed the combined wealth of America\u2019s bottom 50%.\nAsset growth has long outpaced wage growth, which makes real estate one of the most valuable investments a person can make. Almost half of the bottom 50% of Americans\u2019 net worth is tied up in real estate. And while the assets of the 1% dwarf those of the bottom 50%, the latter group claims the highest total mortgage debt at $3.1 trillion, Redfin reported.\nThe analysis adds credence to the frustration of everyday Americans, already discouraged by a real estate market in which the median listing price haslong surpassed $400,000. The median age for first-time buyers is 38 \u2014the oldest on record.\nAdvertisement",

(Of course, there are commercial offerings \u2014 such as condominium buildings \u2014 and other investment sales now listed in the portal that are larger in size.)\nThe discount buzz comes hot on the heels of another posh property,973 Fifth Ave., finally snagging a buyer last month after four years for sale.\nAdam Modlin of the Modlin Group, the broker who nabbed the buyer for that pending sale, now reps the Woolworth pad. He\u2019s crowing that it\u2019s the \u201cbest value\u201d for a place this massive, clocking in at about $2,500 a square foot.\nLucille Roberts, the force behind a women-only gym empire, and her real estate hotshot hubby Bob bought the place for $6 million in 1995 from the Young Men\u2019s Philanthropic League.\nThey poured years into sprucing it up before Lucille passed away in 2003.\nTheir family tried selling it in 2011 for that sky-high $90 million \u2014 hoping to smash townhouse sale records \u2014 but no dice.\nTwo years later, they yanked it off the market after a disgruntled ex-employee of Lucille\u2019s gyms allegedly went rogue, splattering white paint and firing BB pellets at the facade in 2012.\nKevin Roberts, the couple\u2019s son, previously told the Wall Street Journal he bunked there with his dad until 2016. Bob eventually left Manhattan for the Hamptons and Palm Beach, leaving the property to rake in $80,000 a month from a deep-pocketed renter in 2021.\nThe offering, designed by architect C.P.H. Gilbert in 1915 for retail titan Frank Woolworth\u2019s daughter Helena has nine bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, three kitchens \u2014 plus a gym, a library, a sauna and a solarium. Other touches include mosaic tiles, stained glass and a dining room that could host a small army.\nWoolworth, the \u201cFive-and-Dime\u201d king, originally built it as part of a family compound \u2014 two other homes for his kids once stood nearby until their deaths in\u00a01920s.

        "content": "Russian billionaire Valery Kogan and his wife, Olga, have finally sold their over-the-top gilded and onyx-clad Central Park West penthouse for $33.89 million, according to city property records filed on Monday.\nThe sale, at the prestigious 15 Central Park West, also includes the furniture.\nYet, the ritzy residence \u2014 which boasts 24-karat ornaments in what can be characterized as an \u201cextreme-Versailles\u201d style \u2014 once faced foreclosure.\nIt first hit the market for $65 million in 2023 as part of the Kogans\u2019massive real estate sell-offfollowing Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\nResidents at the elite building include titans of industry as well as, in the past, artists and athletes like Sting and Alex Rodriguez. The buyer remains anonymous, hidden behind a shell company \u2014 for now.\nRobert A.M. Stern famously designed the limestone building. But his firm also designed the penthouse, a source said. And the new buyer is hoping that the same team can \u201crefresh\u201d the penthouse to keep it exactly the same, the source added.\nThe sale comes as Kogan is butting heads with Putin over ownership of the Domodedovo airport.\nIn January, Russian news outlet\u00a0Vedomosti\u00a0reported that Russian prosecutorsfiled a caseagainst Kogan and Dmitry Kamenshchik, claiming they failed to renationalize the holding company that manages the facility.\nIt\u2019s not the first time the Russian government tried to take back control of the airport, which was privatized in 1997. In Russia, it\u2019s illegal for foreign entities to control assets deemed to be strategic to national security.\nWhen it first hit the market for $65 million in 2023, the 15 Central Park West listing included a one-bedroom and a studio in the building. They are now slated to sell separately for less than $5 million, sources said.\nFor its part, the 40th-floor penthouse is a sprawling 5,398 square feet. It comes with four bedrooms, an elaborate home office that doubles as a screening room and 3\u00bd bathrooms.\u00a0Extravagant details include a giant malachite stone fireplace and large onyx tables, as well as a stained-glass door. There\u2019s also plenty of carved wood, custom floors and high-end finishes \u2014 not to mention a chef\u2019s kitchen and dazzling city views.\nKogan also recently sold his 7-acre Greenwich, Conn., estate for $10.4 million,as Gimme Shelter previously reported.\nHowever, his palatial pad at the Plaza Hotel \u2014 that comes with a castle-like turret \u2014 is still on the market. Since February, the\u00a0condo has been asking $23 million \u2014 down from the original $50 million ask, as Gimme also noted.\nAn additional one-bedroom apartment in the Plaza across the hall, No. 1008, is asking under $3 million. The listing broker for both apartments is Compass\u2019s Charlie Attias.\nThe Kogans also sold a penthouse in Israel for $33 million and a condo at 515 Park Ave. for $14.5 million, which had first listed for $25 million.\u00a0In addition, they have another home in Israel that first listed for $259 million and is now asking a dramatically less $89 million, according to reports.\nThe listing broker for the 15 Central Park West penthouse, Douglas Elliman\u2019s Adam Rothman, declined to comment.\nAdvertisement",

The week of April 13 to 19 consistently ranks as the best time for a house to hit the market.\nThe mid-April timeframe aligns with peak seasonal pricing, increased buyer demand and lower listing competition \u2014 a winning combination for any home seller.\nThe Realtor.com analysis indicated that sellers can make more money in a shorter amount of time if they list during this sunny window of opportunity, compared to the average week.\nThese fruitful seven days were identified by analyzing average listing performances, measured based on home prices, days on the market, buyer activity and other factors.\nHomes listed between April 13 to 19 historically reached higher prices than the average week, translating to an estimated $4,800 increase in listing prices.\nThe findings are bad news for sellers who jumped the gun earlier this year. Mid-April sales achieve 6.7% higher prices compared to the start of the year. Homes sold in January may have lost up to $27,000 in potential earnings, according to Realtor.com. Post-holiday blues and frigid winter weather do no favors for curb appeal.\nBuyer demand is also more intense during the special spring week. Homes typically get 17.7% more views during April 13 to 19 than the average week. They also sell faster \u2014 an average of nine days faster, the report said.\nSpring sellers will also find that competition loosens up during this golden week, giving their home a chance to stand out. The April 13 to 19 timeframe historically sees 13.2% fewer sellers enter the market, the analysis found.\nThere is less market competition for 2025 sellers in general. National housing inventories have yet to recover to pre-pandemic levels \u2014\u00a0inventory in January was still down 24.8% compared to pre-pandemic times, according to Realtor.com.\nBut buyers beware, while mid-April favors the seller, early October is a winning time for buyers. Demand wanes in the fall as families return to school and busy schedules. Realtor.com previously identified the week ofSept. 29 through Oct. 5as the ideal time for buyers to find the best deals.\nSpring is generally a red-hot time for the broader real estate market as both buyers and sellers unthaw from the winter.\nWarmer weather and blooming gardens bring greater curb appeal to homes, so sellers shouldn\u2019t wait until after the first bloom to list.\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "",
        "content": "Thousands of drivers whiz by the vacant brick building perched precariously over the Mystic River every day without giving it a second thought. But city officials in Everett and Boston have been giving this former sewage pumphouse a lot of thought lately, as they eye it for potential restoration and redevelopment amid the broader rebirth underway around the Encore Boston Harbor casino across the street.Although it\u2019s on the Everett side of the river, the 15,000-square-foot pumphouse actually sits within a tiny sliver of Boston that extends along Alford Street (Route 99). Consultants are about to finish studying the feasibility of redoing the 19th-century building, as soon as this month, on behalf of the cities of Everett and Boston, and funded by state gaming commission funds.Ideas have ranged from turning it into a community center, to a kayak and canoe launch, to a beer hall. The leading concept, though, seems to be a ferry terminal, in part because the Kraft Group is eyeing the site next door to build a soccer stadium for the New England Revolution.\u201cWe\u2019re really excited about it,\u201d said Patrick Herron, executive director of the Mystic River Watershed Association. \u201cWhat a way to breathe life into a historic building on the edge of the water.\u201dAdvertisementKathy Abbott, chief executive of the nonprofit Boston Harbor Now, said the site is an ideal location for a ferry terminal because it\u2019s on the Boston Harbor side of the Alford Street bridge, whose low height prevents many commercial boats from passing under it. (Casino owner Wynn Resorts commissioned ferries purpose-built to fit under the bridge to serve casino customers.)While a boat landing could help with game-day transit for pro soccer games, Abbott said any terminal\u2019s full potential would depend on whether other public transportation projects proposed for the area come to fruition, such as a Silver Line bus-rapid-transit extension or a new commuter rail stop next to the casino.The conversations around the pumphouse, currently owned by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, started a few years ago, long before state lawmakers approved legislation in November that rezones the adjacent site for a soccer stadium. That legislation removes the site next door, home to a shuttered power plant, from what\u2019s known as a Designated Port Area, where only marine industrial uses can be developed.AdvertisementHowever, per state officials, the legislation left the pumphouse property in the DPA. That could pose a challenge to any redevelopment of the site, although a ferry terminal would be an allowed use within the zone. Other challenges include the limited space for parking and a dilapidated seawall that needs to be shored up.Herron said he expects state regulators would be willing to remove the site from the DPA because it\u2019s not currently home to industrial use. (The MWRA stopped pumping at the facility in 1993, replacing it with a more modern facility across the street, though an active sewer pipe passes under one portion of the 1890s building.)Everett and Boston officials are also engaged in discussions about a harborwalk extension that would bring the path along the Mystic River from the casino across the street, under the Alford Street bridge, and around the pumphouse to the stadium site.Tom Philbin, an environmental planner with Everett Mayor Carlo DeMaria\u2019s administration, said Massachusetts Gaming Commission grants have so far provided nearly $250,000 to design the 1,500-foot harborwalk extension and around $200,000 to study the feasibility of restoring the pumphouse. (The money comes out of community mitigation funds overseen by the gaming commission for casino host cities and nearby communities.)In a preliminary community agreement signed with DeMaria in late 2023, the Kraft Group agreed to pay for completing the harborwalk extension from the casino to the soccer stadium site. However, the Revs and Patriots ownership is not currently involved in the talks around the pumphouse\u2019s future.AdvertisementStacy Thompson, interim executive director at Historic Boston, the primary consultant studying the pumphouse\u2019s viability, said the restoration hinges on the eventual price tag. But she remains hopeful that the pumphouse could become an important piece in the broader mosaic of this new urban neighborhood gradually taking shape. At this time, any final decision on the building\u2019s fate would ultimately be up to the MWRA.\u201cThere\u2019s so much potential,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cCould it be a ferry station or a landing point? Yes. Could it be something else that serves the community? Yes. We\u2019re not there yet [but] we\u2019re getting closer to understanding what\u2019s possible.\u201dJon Chesto can be reached at jon.chesto@globe.com. Follow him @jonchesto.",

        "content": "Say goodbye to the days of snagging a cheap starter home in South Florida. That ship has sailed, and it\u2019s been replaced by a yacht for millionaires.\nBack in the day \u2014 particularly five years ago in the early days of COVID-19 \u2014 $1.1 million got buyers a fancy house and a spot among the top dogs. Now, they need $2.6 million just to keep up, and even that won\u2019t buy much. The little guy\u2019s dream of owning a home down there is pretty much kaput.\nThe numbers don\u2019t lie \u2014 and they\u2019re brutal.\nIn Palm Beach County, 24% of houses sold last year went for $1 million or more, according a report from Miller Samuel and Douglas Elliman. Miami-Dade is close behind at 23%.\nThings are speeding up, too. Long-affluent Palm Beach had a 56% jump in million-dollar sales this past December, the biggest spike since May 2021. TheMiami Association of Realtorssays high-end homes are taking over the market, and there\u2019s no stopping it.\n\u201cSouth Florida still doesn\u2019t have enough inventory to meet demand,\u201d says Eddie Blanco, the 2025 Miami Chairman, in the report. \u201cWealth migration to Miami remains high. Buyers from high-taxed, high-density states continue to move here for our jobs, weather and lifestyle.\u201d\nCash rules everything around here \u2014 West Palm Beach was No. 1 in the US last year with 49.6% of sales paid in full upfront, while Fort Lauderdale and Miami hit a respective 38.9% and 38.1%, according to ATTOM.\nThat\u2019s great if you\u2019re loaded, but if you\u2019re stuck with a mortgage and languishing high interest rates, good luck.\nCheck out January 2025: Miami-Dade\u2019s $1 million-plus house sales went up 3.1% to 164 deals, and the middle price for those homes jumped 7.1% to $675,000 \u2014 that\u2019s a jaw-dropping 184.2% more than it was in January 2015.\nCondos aren\u2019t cheap either \u2014 their middle price crept up 2.3% to $415,000, nearly 120% higher than a decade ago.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the spring market off to a healthy start, with sales and prices broadly up from one year ago,\u201d says Miami Realtors chief economist Gay Cororaton in a report. \u201cWhat\u2019s driving the market is the upper price tier, with strong growth in the $600,000 and over and million-dollar market.\u201d\nFor the super-rich, it\u2019s a feeding frenzy.\nIn Miami-Dade, the price for a top 5% house shot up 22% in 2024 to $3.3 million, and the top 1% \u201cultra-fancy\u201d ones hit $10 million, a 38% jump, perMiami MLS data.\nCondo prices for the big spenders climbed too \u2014 $2.3 million for the top 5% and $6.3 million for the top 1%. Golden Beach is king with a middle million-dollar price of $8.7 million, followed by spots like Bal Harbour ($3.1 million) and Pinecrest ($2.6 million).\nBut starter homes? They\u2019re history.\nSure, some cheaper condos are selling\u2014$200,000 to $250,000 ones went up 10.3% to 75 sales, and $400,000 to $600,000 ones rose 4.7% to 178 in January 2025. But with barely any homes to buy \u2014 inventory\u2019s down 9.9% from normal, and condo listings are 27.3% below pre-COVID days \u2014 it\u2019s slim pickings.\nFlorida\u2019s trying to help with a law pushing developers to build affordable homes, but it\u2019s not enough when the wealthy keep pouring in.\nBottom line: South Florida\u2019s a millionaire\u2019s paradise now. They\u2019re scooping up huge homes with cash while average Americans are having trouble getting their foot in the door. With home equity gains almost double the national average \u2014 $542,175 in Miami-Dade from 2009 to 2024 compared to $310,232 nationwide \u2014 becoming a homeowner there is growing increasingly difficult.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "This California listing sure \u201cangled\u201d its way into an all-out bidding war.\nA midcentury-modern home in the Berkeley Hills outside of San Francisco \u2014 and one designed by the locally prominent architect John Hans Ostwald \u2014 has sold for $1.6 million, marking a breathtaking increase that was more than double the listing\u2019s asking price.\nWhat\u2019s more, the striking hexagonal residence, which asked $795,000 for sale, only spent two weeks on the market, The Post has learned.\nListed on Feb. 6, the property went into contract 14 days later, fetching 101% over the list price in a frenzy of buyer interest that saw more than 30 offers, 70 private showings, 300 inquiries and more than 1,000 visitors swarm its open houses.\nNeedless to say, the home\u2019s explosive demand caught listing agent, Jodi Nishimura of Kai Real Estate, off guard.\n\u201cWe knew that the [midcentury-modern] vibe and hexagon shape of the home would be interesting, but did not expect as many people to be drawn to the home,\u201d she told The Post.\nThe listing kicked off with a brokers\u2019 tour on Feb. 5, followed by a late-day open house where \u201cpeople were in awe at the incredible sunset during the twilight hours.\u201d\nBy the weekend, the Saturday open house burned through 100 brochures in just two and a half hours, while Sunday saw an unrelenting stream of visitors.\n\u201cOne of our open houses counted over 300 people,\u201d Nishimura said.\nPriced as a \u201cteaser\u201d in a competitive East Bay market, the home\u2019s allure among many prospective buyers stemmed from a perfect storm of factors, with Nishimura citing the ask, its design, its location and market conditions.\nThis architectural treasure, named the Foley House, was commissioned in 1963 by a dental hygienist who remained its sole owner until her recent passing.\nSpanning 1,300 square feet, the two-bedroom, two-bathroom residence boasts panoramic views of the San Francisco Bay, the Golden Gate Bridge and Marin County, all framed by its distinctive geometric design and pristine original features.\nExposed redwood rafters, refinished oak floors, a copper fireplace, and period details like grass cloth wallpaper and bubble lampshades have been meticulously preserved since its construction more than six decades ago.\nOstwald, a Berlin-born architect who transitioned from law to design, left his mark on the Bay Area with his Swiss-inspired functional aesthetic. Known for blending homes seamlessly with their natural surroundings, he collaborated with California luminaries like Richard Neutra, while also designing local landmarks such as the Bancroft Center and St. John\u2019s Presbyterian Church.\n\u201cWhat dental hygienist can commission a home in Berkeley in this era?\u201d Nishimura quipped, later adding, \u201cIt\u2019s a very rare property. There are a bunch of [midcentury] homes in the area but this is one of the most unique.\u201d\nAnd it was a lure for many.\nThe buyer pool ranged widely, from \u201cyoung professionals who are enamored with [midcentury] architecture\u201d to architects and designers of all ages.\nThe winning bidder, who offered $1.6 million, had a personal connection to Ostwald\u2019s work.\n\u201cThe buyer fell in love with the architect by visiting a friend\u2019s home designed by the same architect, so when this became available they really wanted [it],\u201d Nishimura said.\nThe Berkeley Hills location didn\u2019t hurt either, with neighbors like Robert Reich, the journalist Michael Pollan, and director Michael Lewis adding a touch of star power to the community.\nAll this said, and as for the broader market, Nishimura sees a resurgence.\n\u201cThe luxury market in San Francisco is coming back strong. And top neighborhoods in the East Bay are doing very well,\u201d she said. \u201cThere continues to be such a dearth of inventory and this is such a desirable place to live that competition remains fierce for the best homes.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

We restored everything and paid close attention to the original details including the amazing wedding veil plaster ceiling, the plaster coves at the top of the walls,\u201d Justin Lance said.\nThe well-appointed residence features nine bedrooms, 3\u00bd baths and five fireplaces. It\u2019s fully renovated and sits on 0.37 acres.\nOriginal and restored design details include hand-carved woodwork and banisters that rise up three floors through a center hallway \u2014 as well as plaster crown moldings, wide-plank wood floors, pocket doors and high ceilings.\nThe home also boasts an original wall of built-in bookcases in the library/home office.

        "content": "Winter in New York City often enjoys a cooler real estate market, but not this year.\nRenters in Manhattan were met with record-high rents in February, with a median rent of $4,500 \u2014 a 6.4% uptick from the same time last year. Prices also rose in Brooklyn and Queens as vacancy rates tightened,a new reportfrom Douglas Elliman revealed.\nEveryone, from renters to agents, is feeling the heat.\n\u201cThe fact is, there\u2019s not a lot of room to negotiate,\u201d Douglas Wagner, BOND New York\u2019s director of brokerage services, told The Post.\nThe early bird no longer gets the worm when it comes to applications, either.\nIt\u2019s all about who can offer more, according to Laurel Ferrera, an agent at Keller Williams NYC. Units are advertising at low prices to whip up interest, Ferrera said in an email, and then taking as many applications as possible.\n\u201cA place on the Upper West Side that was initially marketed at $3,700 for a one bed, one bath ended up being rented for $800 above asking,\u201d Ferrera wrote. \u201cThe agent told me, \u2018The people who got their apartment [are] willing to go higher if needed.\u2019\u201d\nA quarter of Manhattan deals in February sparked bidding wars, the Elliman report found, also marking a record high. Experts blame the increased competition, in part, on an uncertain economy, skittish homebuyers and back-to-office mandates.\nFerrera\u2019s recent client, Alex K. \u2014 who didn\u2019t reveal her full name for privacy \u2014 thought starting her apartment search in February would give her the upper hand. She was quickly disabused of that theory.\n\u201cI\u2019d always heard that winter is a lot easier to find places,\u201d she told the Post. \u201cBut everybody just seems to want to come back to the city now.\u201d\nAlex, who is moving from California to New York for work, said she and Ferrara looked at more than a dozen apartments across Brooklyn and Manhattan. In the process, she ended up in four separate bidding wars.\nOne of the bid-upon units was a Cobble Hill one-bedroom that, Alex said, someone else paid $800 above the asking price for.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure some people have dual incomes, but it\u2019s just me, and I can\u2019t compete with that,\u201d Alex said.\nThe Elliman report found February\u2019s Brooklyn listings had even fiercer competition than Manhattan, with35% of deals resulting in bidding wars.\nCompared to Manhattan and Brooklyn, housing inventory in Northwest Queens saw a generous increase. The103% uptickin available listings in February may have contributed to a higher rate of the borough\u2019s landlords willing to make concessions, eager to attract choosier tenants. Still, bidding wars were documented in a fifth of all deals in Queens.\nThe Elliman analysis also documented a faster rise in the median rent of non-doorman buildings than doorman buildings. Wagner said he has noticed renters aspiring to more outfitted, upgraded apartments, and he said they\u2019re willing to give up an amenity, like a doorman, to get those features.\n\u201cIf the non-doorman apartment is well-equipped, and there\u2019s a washer-dryer in the apartment, and the rooms are not tiny, it makes a huge difference,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cPeople will maybe give up the idea of a doorman and a health club to save a little bit of money, if they can get something better than an Easy Bake kitchen.\u201d\nIf an apartment today is equipped well and priced well, Wagner said, there will be a line out the door.\nWagner predicts an even hotter summer for the market, with prices remaining high and units staying competitive. He advised those looking for better value to consider looking outside the city\u2019s prime locations, likeSouthern Brooklyn or Eastern Queens.\nAfter fighting their way through the bidding wars, Alex K. and her broker Ferrera eventually found the perfect place in Gramercy. In order to snag it, Alex K. offered the owners $400 over its asking price, landing her right at her max budget of $4,000.\n\u201cI saw it on StreetEasy, I was like, \u2018I feel like that\u2019s my place,\u2019\u201d she said.\nHer bid won out over nine other offers, gaining her a two-year lease at the co-op building, which comes with a live-in super and a community garden.\n\u201cI got a great place. It\u2019s a good location for my first couple years in New York,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I love the place, I love the owner. So I got really lucky.\nAdvertisement",

The open layout flows seamlessly into a chef\u2019s kitchen, decked out with top-tier Gaggenau appliances.\nStep outside, and the perks keep coming. Wraparound balconies serve up sweeping vistas of the Atlantic Ocean and Miami\u2019s skyline. But the real showstopper is a massive private rooftop that crowns the entire property, complete with a private 15-by-30 negative-edge pool, a spa and a slick outdoor kitchen featuring Viking gear.\nA glass LED staircase ties it all together, offering unobstructed 360-degree views. Packed with cutting-edge tech, the penthouse even includes a Savant smart home system for effortless control.\nSarah Williams, the founder of Societe Real Estate, held the listing and declined to comment on the sale. Representing Hafner were Michael Duchon and Eloy Carmenate of Corcoran, who also declined to comment.\nHafner co-founded Kayak in 2004 alongside tech whiz Paul English, turning it into a go-to metasearch engine for flights, hotels, car rentals and vacation deals.\nThe platform, which first hit the web in 2005, evolved from its original name, Travel Search Company, Inc., to Kayak Software Corporation later that year.\nBefore that, Hafner cut his teeth in the travel industry by helping launch Orbitz in 1999, where he spearheaded business growth, ad sales and marketing.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "Young adults have beenflocking to small townsand rural areas at the most dramatic pace in decades\u2014and it\u2019s a trend that\u2019s not letting up anytime soon.\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic, internal migration took an unexpected turn withlarge numbers of younger adultsaged 25 to 44 flocking to these areas. And as a result, they\u2019ve been fueling a small-town revival, according to\u00a0Hamilton Lombard, estimates program manager of the Demographics Research Group at the University of Virginia\u2019sWeldon Cooper Center for Public Research.\nThe 2023 county population estimates released by theU.S. Census Bureauin spring 2024 showed that since 2020, two-thirds of growth in the population occurred in areas with fewer than 1 million residents, or in rural counties.\nAnd despite many companies mandating a return to the office, the migration of younger adults into these areas accelerated in 2023.\n\u201cPerhaps the most striking statistic within the 2023 age estimates is the fact that since 2020, the country\u2019s small towns and rural areas have been attracting younger adults at the highest rate in nearly a century,\u201d writes Lombard.\nThis is in stark contrast to the past decade, where 90% of this growth was concentrated in the largest metro areas with more than 4 million residents.\nStarting in the late 1970s, young adults pursuing well-paying jobs in white-collar industries started fleeing areas with populations of fewer than 250,000 people in favor ofplaces like\u00a0New York City,\u00a0San Francisco, and\u00a0Washington, DC.\nBy the 1990s, this large-scale exodus caused a change in the population, where many of these areas failed to gain new residents younger than 45. That continued into the 2010s when migration into larger metros reached its highest point in more than a half-century.\n\u201cThe migration of young adults from rural to urban areas caused communities to become increasingly unbalanced demographically,\u201d writes Lombard.\nFor example,\u00a0Arlington County, VA,\u00a0across the Potomac River from Washington, DC, which saw its population of young adults grow faster than in any other county within the nation\u2019s 20 largest metros, had six times as many younger residents as those over age 65.\nMeanwhile, in the more rural\u00a0Highland County, VA,\u00a0along Virginia\u2019s western border, the over-65 population was twice the size of residents aged 25 to 44.\nAs the 2010s rolled on, Lombard writes that all the census and economic data were pointing to the age divide between rural and urban areas growing ever wider.\nBut in 2020, just as the U.S., along with the rest of the world, was walloped by the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, the demographic trajectory made an unexpected U-turn.\nDuring the 2010s, 90% of the growth in the young adult population was concentrated in the nation\u2019s largest metros with over 4 million residents. But since 2020, 75% of the growth in the 25-to-44 demographic has been seen in cities with populations of less than 1 million, or in rural enclaves.\nLombard stresses, however, that America\u2019s millennials and Gen Z are strategic about which rural areas they choose to decamp to, favoring those regions that have top natural amenities.\nNatural amenities refer to region-specific characteristics like an area\u2019s climate, landscape, open spaces, and bodies of water, including lakes and oceans, according to theU.S. Department of Agriculture.\nFor example, Colorado\u2019s remote Chafee County, located in the Rocky Mountains and boasting a high USDA natural amenity score, has seen its younger workforce double compared with the national rate over the past 10 years.\nMeanwhile, counties in Southern Appalachia\u2019s coal country, which are low on natural amenities, have experienced a dearth of youth migration.\nDuring the pandemic, when remote working was enforced, the concept of \u201cZoom towns\u201d became a phenomenon. These remote suburbs and rural areas soon saw an influx of city workers ridding themselves of their cramped apartments and homes in favor of larger and more affordable living.\nMany companies, includingJ.P. MorganandGoogle, have since reversed their pandemic-era work-from-home policies. But despite that, data analyzed by Lombard shows that many workers have been able to retain what he calls \u201cgeographic flexibility.\u201d\nIn other words, the growth of young adult populations in most rural counties was accompanied by a surge in incomes, suggesting that many were able to hold on to their remote work arrangements in the post-pandemic years.\nAnd what\u2019s more, economic data suggest that the former city dwellers-turned-rural residents have not just been sitting in Zoom meetings all this time.\nFrom 2019 to 2023,IRS applicationsto launch new businesses in the smallest metro areas and rural counties shot up 13% faster than in other parts of the U.S.\nNot surprisingly, remote areas with top natural amenities, such as forests and lakes, experienced the most dramatic increases in new business activity.\nWhile it is undeniable that COVID-19 and the resulting surge in remote work turbocharged the migration of younger adults, Lombard argues that some crucial demographic trends predated the global calamity.\nCensus figures indicate that by 2017, rural counties had already started to draw more residents in the 25-to-44 bracket than they were losing. At the same time, the nation\u2019s biggest and priciest metros, among them Los Angeles and New York City, were experiencing an outflow of young professionals.\n\u201cThe booming economy of the late 2010s made moving farther from major job centers more financially feasible,\u201d according to Lombard. \u201cRising housing prices in large metro areas also made more affordable small towns increasingly attractive.\u201d\nBased on existing demographic trends, Lombard predicts that in years to come, smaller cities and rural communities, particularly those with \u201centicing amenities,\u201d will continue to attract younger remote workers seeking greater flexibility.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "A sumptuous Gilded Age apartment at a prime Gramercy Park address is on the market.\nA newly listed residence asking $6.6 million at 34 Gramercy Park East includes five rooms, soaring ceilings and keys to Manhattan\u2019s most famous exclusive park \u2014 Gramercy Park, which stands behind gates. That rarified access, combined with the unit\u2019s ornate 19th-century details, make this listing an extra hot commodity.\nMoreover, that price buys a prime piece of city history. The building at 34 Gramercy Park East claims the title of the oldest surviving co-op in the city, according to architectural historian Andrew Alpern. The 10-story, 45 unit residence was built in 1883 \u2014 the same year the Brooklyn Bridge opened.\n(Co-ops, as opposed to condominiums, are where buyers own shares in the building, rather than the real property of the homes themselves.)\nResidents in the Queen Anne-style building covet not only its prime location and ornate decor.\nThe apartment is in the same landmarked building where British model and actress Cara Delevingnebought Jimmy Fallon\u2019s four-unit triplexin 2022 for $10.8 million. Actor Richard Gerealso purchasedan eight-floor condo there in 2016 for $2.25 million.\nThe for-sale unit is located on the entry floor of the building, and spans around 1,900 square feet. It includes three flexible bedrooms and two bathrooms, plus a salon and kitchen. The listing, held by Lynne C. Lerner of Compass, describes the unit\u2019s \u201chistoric charm,\u201d with Gilded Age architectural details that transport residents to \u201can era of elegance and refinement.\u201d\nThe apartment\u2019s entrance speaks to the grandeur within, featuring non-original parquet flooring with an intricate, inlaid marquetry border, as well as a hand-painted Chinese wall covering. A park-facing salon includes original hardwood floors, an opulent chandelier and a marble fireplace at its focal point. Thirteen-foot ceilings span the apartment.\n\u201cYou see 13 foot ceilings in a lot of modern buildings and some loft conversions, but it\u2019s beautiful to see it in the building of this era,\u201d Lerner told The Post.\nThe lacquer-red primary suite includes a striking floor-to-ceiling chifforobe and an en-suite bath covered in green marble tiles. A second bedroom, currently used as a den, is floor-to-ceiling mahogany, featuring an original fireplace and shuttered windows with stained glass detailing.\nThe final bedroom includes yet another fireplace and even more Gilded Age details in its molding and trim.\nThe home last changed hands in 2004,whenreporter Stone Phillips, the former co-anchor of Dateline NBC, sold the unit to a man named Michael Stotsky, according to city records.\nThe lobby itself is a sight to beyond, with a Tiffany glass ceiling and mosaic tiling. Despite its opulence, 34 Gramercy Park East comes from humble origins. The red brick and terra cotta facade was constructed as a middle class alternative to tenement housing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very unique property, and very well preserved,\u201d Lerner said. \u201cIt kind of transports you back to 1883.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

Tuff Shed prebuilt most of the interior and the two balconies and patio. Cook\u2019s floor plan was all in her head.\n\u201cI\u2019d tell them, put the window 2 feet from the door,\u201d she says.\nThe couple, who have no formal construction training, hired professionals for the crawl space foundation, electric, plumbing, and spray foam insulation. The lot already had a well and septic tank. A builder made sure everything was up to county house code.\nThe \u201cshome\u201d (combination of \u201cshed\u201d and \u201chome\u201d) ended up with two bedrooms, 2.5 bathrooms, two balconies, a full kitchen with a gas range and a large sunken island, laundry closet, and large patio.\nThe stylish but homey interior is Cook\u2019s vision, a look she calls \u201ca blend of farmhouse and beach house\u2014even though it\u2019s on a lake.\u201d\nWhere Cook could have gone with drywall for the ceilings and walls, she insisted on tongue and groove and shiplap.\n\u201cI did that shiplap all by myself,\u201d she says proudly. \u201cIt came out beautiful, but it took a long time.\u201d\nThe unfinished kitchen cabinets were stock from Lowe\u2019s that Cook painted sage green to complement the green-infused Brazilian granite countertops that she fell for despite their hefty $6,000 price tag.\n\u201cI just like what I like,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything came out the way I saw it in my head.\u201d\nCook also found vintage and Hobby Lobby pieces to jazz up the farmhouse-inspired decor (mostly bought from Lowe\u2019s and Home Depot).\nThere are also the whimsical touches such as the fish sink in one bathroom and a video arcade game in the kitchen. The floors are vinyl plank with custom carpet on the stairs and upper floors, to make them more kid-friendly.\nWhen a plumber left a drain line for the upstairs bathroom bulging from the kitchen wall, Richard improvised, building a matching sage-green birdhouse over the stove to stylishly conceal it.\nNot wanting to waste any space in the 1,296-square-foot shed, Cook added a half-bath under the stairs, along with a \u201cclubhouse\u201d for her grandkids.\nThe cost to turn a shed into a home was approximately $170,000 (minus the shell).\nThe couple lived in it for six months while carrying out the renovation. They decided to list it so they could move on to their next project: a barndominium.\nThe shed-house received many offers and was sold over the asking price at $460,000.\nEven so, Cook feels if she\u2019d waited six months, \u201cI could have gotten an extra $100,000.\u201d\nShe also believes the home was priced too low because it can be listed only as a one-bedroom, despite having two, due to the home being on a \u201cone-bedroom septic.\u201d\n\u201cThat hurt us on the appraisal,\u201d she says. However, the lake-view location definitely helped the home\u2019s popularity.\nCook admits, \u201cWe made a lot of money off it.\u201d\nSo did the buyer, whosoldit in March 2025, closing at $505,000.\nAs to whether Cook will make a career of turning sheds into swoon-worthy homes, she laughs.\n\u201cIf somebody hired me, I\u2019d probably want to. I know my husband and kids want me to.\u201d\nDaughter\u00a0Amanda McCormick, who made the TikTok reels showing off her mom\u2019s work, has bigger ideas.\n\u201cI want her to get a TV show,\u201d she says.\nAdvertisement",

That deal now marks the most expensive apartment ever sold downtown, narrowly beating the 2018 record set by billionaire Robert F. Smith\u2019s$59 million penthouse purchasein Chelsea.\nThis recent off-market transaction not only met the sellers\u2019 exact asking price, but also earned them double what they paid for the unit in 2016.\nThe deal was closed on Thursdaythrough a co-listing between Jim St. Andr\u00e9 of Compass and Peter Zaitzeff of Serhant. The Wall Street Journalfirst reported on the sale.\nThe 5,840-square-foot waterfront apartment boasts views of the Hudson River and a large outdoor terrace. While it\u2019s a notable deal for the downtown area, it\u2019s far from the city\u2019s \u2014 and the nation\u2019s \u2014 priciest home sale. Ken Griffin\u2019s roughly $238 million purchase of a multi-story residence inside 220 Central Park South in 2019 continues to hold both of those records.\nThis just-sold home at 150 Charles includes five bedrooms and 5.5 bathrooms. While little about the interiors of the unit has been advertised, the listing photos show a spacious, modern home with ample natural light and a neutral color palette.\nAn eat-in kitchen features marbled countertops and a backsplash, and a spiraling staircase adds artistic flair to the home\u2019s minimalist design.\nA Serhant promotional video for the listing from November also flaunted$500,000 parking spacesbelow the building.\nThe sellers are financier Harsh Padia, of Hap Capital Advisors, and his wife,interior designer Purvi Padia. The pair bought the apartment in 2016 from the building\u2019s developer, Alex Witkoff, for $29 million. The Padias sold the unit to an unidentified buyer.\nThis isn\u2019t Padia\u2019s first downtown sale. Harsh Padia previously owneda 5-story penthouse at 471 Washington St. that he sold in 2021 for $17.6 million, according to the city register.\nThe 15-story, full-service building at 150 Charles St. is highly coveted real estate in its historic West Village neighborhood. Witkoff opened the 91-unit building in 2013 \u2014 and A-listers includingBon Jovi, Ben Stiller,Ryan Seacrestand Irina Shayk have since called it home.\nThe full-service building includes concierge services, a gym and a private courtyard.\nAdvertisement",

It was heavily featured in the boundary-breaking 1996 box office hit \u201cThe Birdcage,\u201d starring Williams and Lane, as well as the recently deceasedGene Hackmanand Hank Azaria.\nThe film, based on the 1979 farcical French film \u201cLa Cage Aux Folles,\u201d follows a gay couple \u2014 portrayed by Williams and Lane \u2014 whose son is marrying into the family of a conservative senator, played by Hackman.\nThe hotel was also favored by the late Karl Lagerfeld, who premiered Chanel\u2019s resort line along the Raleigh\u2019s iconic coast-of-arms pool in 2008.\nThe hotel will once again open its doors to Miami\u2019s rich and famous thanks to the $1 billion overhaul by developer Micahel Shvo, whose SHVO company purchased the down-on-its-luck property with a group of developers in 2019.\nRenownedarchitect Peter Marinogave the 60-key hotel a refresh, and constructed a 17-story residential tower next door. The Raleigh will be managed by Rosewood Hotels, a luxury hotel and resort company.\nThe newly constructed glass tower will host 40 coveted waterfront residences. These units range in size from two to five bedrooms and will run you anywhere from $10 to $150 million, the Daily Mail reported.\nThe luxurious homes boast large terraces, stone flooring and bathrooms with refrigerators just for beauty products. The revamped hotel next door will continue to offer high-end amenities including a full spa, a fitness center and a private beach club.\nThe Rosewood collaboration marks a second chance at life for the landmarked hotel. The property was previously owned by Tommy Hilfiger\u2019s Hilfiger Hospitality, but the destruction of Hurricane Irma in 2017 closed the hotel in the midst of much-needed repairs.\nMove-in day for the residences is expected to arrive in late 2027. Shvo told the Daily Mail that \u201cmost\u201d of the residences have already sold to cash offers, with a total of $250 million in pre-sales so far.Such a high uptake would be an impressive feat amidFlorida\u2019s softening housing market, which saw a record number of unsold listings in January.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "Five Years Later\n\n\n\n Lessons for the next pandemic\nFive years ago this week, Boston was unrecognizable. Its normally bustling streets were deserted. Its office towers and arenas empty. Its restaurants dark. The days stretched to weeks, then months, of wondering when the people would come back.Eventually, they did.Five years after COVID shut down Boston, things feel, by and large, normal again. There are lines at lunch spots, crowds at the Garden, college kids at the bars. But the city isn\u2019t the same.Measures of foot traffic and office vacancy haven\u2019t fully rebounded. Hybrid work remains pretty common. Car traffic is worse. Empty storefronts persist.But more than anything, we just don\u2019t mix like we did before.A Northeastern University study of cellphone data found that when COVID hit, inhabitants of Greater Boston became far less likely to interact with people of different socioeconomic backgrounds. Those numbers have been recovering, but for many parts of the region, particularly in the suburbs, levels of what researchers call \u201csocial exploration\u201d have fallen sharply.\nAdvertisementAnd that\u2019s bad news for a city whose culture and economy have, for centuries, been built on people mixing, connecting, and sharing ideas, said Northeastern University physicist Esteban Moro, who\u2019s leading the study. Bad enough that it raises questions about what cities like Boston are for, now, and how we make them places that people connect once again.\u201cCities are these social engines that put together people,\u201d Moro said. \u201cThis is the purpose of the city, right?\u201dRelated: Five Years Later: Lessons for the next pandemicThese days, that engine isn\u2019t working like it used to. Moro and his colleagues at Northeastern\u2019s Social Urban Networks Group track the movement of people across cities, and when they look at Greater Boston they see, basically, less movement. Generally, people in the most affluent suburbs are staying in their affluent suburbs. People in the region\u2019s lower income corners stay there, too.It\u2019s an indicator of the diminished role that downtown plays in the daily lives of Bostonians. According to recent figures from the Downtown Boston Alliance, about 20,000 fewer people work downtown than did five years ago, and they come in, on average, about three fewer days per month. Add it up, and the work trips into the core of the city district have fallen by almost half.AdvertisementIt\u2019s the sort of challenge Boston has faced before, said Karilyn Crockett, a former city director of economic policy and research who now teaches urban planning at MIT. In the 1950s and \u201860s, as residents decamped to the suburbs and jobs followed, Boston responded by constructing skyscrapers that signaled to the world that the city was a place for doing business. It\u2019s time, Crockett said, to find a new signal.A view of the Boston skyline at morning. David L. Ryan/Globe Staff\u201cThe fundamental thing that we\u2019re asking is where are people?\u201d she said. \u201cWhere is the center of gravity in the city, whether for shopping or for hanging out or for work? Where do people come together?\u201dIncreasingly, that\u2019s neighborhoods where people do more than work. While foot traffic downtown remains below pre-pandemic levels, according to city data, it\u2019s nearly back citywide, and up in places such as Fenway and Longwood. What\u2019s the difference? These \u201cmultipurpose\u201d neighborhoods, as Moro describes them, provide chances to live, work, and play in more equal measure.That\u2019s something the Wu administration is trying to do downtown, offering a generous tax break to help convert underused older office buildings into housing. Mayor Michelle Wu said the city has received applications to convert 20 buildings into 760 units of housing, 153 of which will be income restricted.Related: \u2018The lockdowns were never really effective\u2019: New research shows COVID stay-at-home orders did more harm than good\u201cEvery building that comes back to life makes a difference,\u201d Wu said.Even office buildings that aren\u2019t being converted are seeing new life.Take 63 Franklin St., an old bank headquarters in Downtown Crossing. In December, job-training nonprofit Breaktime paid $6.3 million to buy it to house their 40-plus employees, a health clinic, and retail space where the teens Breaktime works with can hold jobs \u2014 showing how a downturn in office values can open new doors for new ideas.AdvertisementThe city\u2019s trying other things too, like doling out $10 million in federal COVID relief funds to help 90 small businesses find a toehold in empty storefronts, and pushing Beacon Hill to provide 225 new liquor licenses, which it will distribute across the city to spur new restaurants in all corners of Boston.But these efforts are fighting an uphill battle.The empty floors of a downtown office building and streets below as the city of Boston emptied out on March 13, 2020.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffTakeout orders were prepared at Soleil in Roxbury in 2021. The restaurant had to turn to takeout during the pandemic. Jonathan Wiggs/Globe StaffThe pandemic accelerated a shift toward online shopping that was taking hold well before COVID, and the rise of takeout \u2014 in place of restaurant meals \u2014 has persisted, too, Moro\u2019s data shows. Remote work and even hybrid arrangements mean people congregate less often downtown, for both work and play.People like Brenda Bond-Fortier, a professor in the Sawyer Business School at Suffolk University, who studies organizational change and has witnessed it herself in the wake of the pandemic.Bond-Fortier used to spend her days downtown, at Suffolk. Today, she\u2019s teaching her graduate classes online, from her home in southern New Hampshire, and ventures in just two days a week. She misses the bustle of Boston and seeing her colleagues, but she doesn\u2019t miss spending 10 hours a week in the car.\u201cI\u2019m very blessed where I have job with a bit more flexibility in terms of when I do and don\u2019t go to the city,\u201d she said.Related: Six things we got wrong about COVID-19, from washing groceries to herd immunityTo Crockett, even the word \u201cdowntown\u201d feels a bit archaic, as it implies we\u2019re all going to the same place.

A Harry Potter exhibit has lately drawn throngs to an empty old Best Buy at the CambridgeSide mall. \u201cCompetitive socializing\u201d is all the rage in the Seaport, where different venues offer mini-golf, ping pong, bowling, pickleball, or darts. And the recent arrival of new spaces where people can both shop and linger \u2014 be it at Beacon Hill Books & Cafe, or the batting-cage-boasting Dick\u2019s House of Sport in Back Bay \u2014 are models for how businesses can transform an errand into an event.Even small businesses are attempting to be a little bit of everything.Related: \u2018We really never came back to each other\u2019: Five years after COVID, we\u2019re more divided than everIn the wake of the pandemic, Justin Sorbo and two colleagues left their longstanding jobs at gym chain Equinox to open Pearl Street Fitness training studio in the Financial District.

We\u2019re definitely shooting for a tighter community here, and we do have that.\u201dBut there\u2019s a catch. All of these new places are private spaces, and many of them quite pricey.That\u2019s a challenge in a city that aspires to be for all of its people, said Ted Landsmark, director of Northeastern\u2019s Dukakis Center for Urban and Regional Policy. Cities, after all, aren\u2019t just blocks and buildings, but places where \u201cjoyful interactions\u201d can bring people together.Related: More than 1 million Americans have died of COVID-19. Why is there no national day to remember them?\u201cIt\u2019s incumbent on public leadership to encourage those kinds of informal interactions,\u201d Landsmark said, \u201cparticularly around entertainment, shopping, play, and culture.\u201dThat can take various forms, he said, from public art to public gatherings \u2014 both of which the Wu administration has experimented with \u2014 to lowering T fares on weekends to draw more young people downtown. It can mean ensuring that major developments include space for civic life \u2014 such as the popular new plaza atop the Massachusetts Turnpike at the Lyrik building. And it can mean making more of the public spaces Boston is fortunate to have, especially along Boston Harbor, where longstanding efforts to increase access still have a ways to go.A pedestrian walked through the Lyrik Plaza area built for people to gather that is part of a new development built over the Mass.

The city is also looking to increase access to its world-class cultural institutions, and attempting to find ways to make them feel more welcoming to people from across the city.That\u2019s the idea behind Boston Family Days, a program Wu launched in 2024 and expanded this year. It allows any family in Boston with children to visit any of nine museums on the first two Sundays of each month for free. Over 44,000 people participated in 2024, and 11,000 more have signed on this year.\u201cEvery young person in the city deserves to feel at home in every part of our city,\u201d Wu said.Related: During COVID, vaccines were the path to \u2018herd immunity.\u2019 Now, a growing number don\u2019t want to be part of the herd.Indeed, Wu said, we all know what cities need to thrive. Even kids. Every year, Wu meets with a kindergarten class at the Boston Society of Architects, and organizers ask the kids to design a model city. You might think they\u2019d draw skyscrapers, Wu said, but the kids had other plans.During a recent showcase, the mayor recalled, one child drew gigantic beds \u2014 so everyone would have a place to sleep \u2014 another designed a free ice cream store, and a third a massive owls\u2019 nest. Why? So the owls can come out at night and catch all the rats.\u201cEven at a young age our kindergartners understand our cities have to be safe, beautiful, welcoming and fun,\u201d Wu said. \u201cEspecially now, when everything does feel so disjointed and isolated, people are looking for experiences to have together.\u201dThat\u2019s what cities have always been for. Before that week they shut down five years ago. And still today.\n\n\nHow we reported this story\nThe \"social exploration\" data in this story come from an analysis by a team of researchers from the Social Urban Networks Lab at Northeastern University\u2019s Network Science Institute. They are: Esteban Moro, Hamish Gibbs, and Bijin Joseph.\n\r\nTheir analysis examines movement patterns across the core Boston metro Area, leveraging millions of anonymized and aggregated visits derived from mobile phone data. The researchers measured the proportion of movements occurring between areas (census block groups) with different income levels, defined using income quantiles based on median household income estimates from the US Census Bureau.\r\n\nThe changes depict the shift in social exploration, aggregated by ZIP code, between 2019 and 2024.\r\n\n\nYoohyun Jung and Catherine Carlock of the Globe staff contributed to this report.Janelle Nanos can be reached at janelle.nanos@globe.com.

        "content": "Renters across the U.S. can breathe a sigh of relief, at least for the time being, asrent pricesnationwide have fallen for the 19th straight month\u2014but a looming construction shortage could spell trouble in the near future.\nThe median asking rent price across the 50 largest metros slid to $1,691 in February, shedding $15 compared with the same time a year ago, writesRealtor.com\u00aesenior economistJoel Bernerin theFebruary 2025 Rental Report.\nEven though the rents have been gradually decreasing over the past year and a half, the bad news is that Americans are still paying much more for housing than they did before the COVID-19 pandemic, when the national rent was over 14% lower.\nThe declining rental rates have been a double-edged sword because they have made building multifamily housing less appealing to investors over the past few years.\nAccording to Berner, that could result in lower rental unit inventory going forward and, in turn, cause rent prices to go up.\nIn 2024, fewer than 294,000 units in multifamily rentals were permitted for construction across the 50 largest metros from coast to coast, the lowest number since 2017.\nEven at the height of the pandemic in 2020, there were more units permitted, at 318,000.\n\u201cThis represents a major retreat in multifamily construction permitting, no doubt due to the fact that rents were falling year over year throughout 2024,\u201d says Berner.\nAccording to economists\u2019 projections, if the supply of new rental units continues dwindling, as the latest permitting figures suggest, the downward trajectory of rent prices may not be sustained.\n\u201cWe expect rents to start to grow again in the coming years as the pace of new units hitting the market slows,\u201d warns Berner.\nNew York Cityin February earned the dubious honor of having the highest annual rent growth of any metro in the U.S.\nThe median rent for an apartment in New York City climbed to an eye-popping $2,977, up nearly 7% from the same time last year, and more than $1,000 than the current national median.\nThe dramatic price surge followed a slight dip in multifamily permitting in New York City, which saw 42,230 construction permits issued in 2024, a downtick of 9.5% from 2019.\n\u201cWe expect rent to continue to rise in the Big Apple for this reason,\u201d notes Berner.\nNine other major metros experienced rising rent prices amid a dearth of permitted multifamily units, includingBaltimore,Boston,Detroit, andSan Jose, CA.\nIt\u2019s not all doom and gloom when it comes to rental supply. The latest data analyzed by Realtor.com researchers showed a lot of regional variation in inventory and rent price levels.\nNine of the top 50 metros experienced a boost in multifamily permitting in 2024 than the previous five years at the same time that rents decreased year over year.\n\u201cWhere demand is already weakening and supply is expanding, we anticipate more significant downward pressure on rents,\u201d according to Berner.\nA typical rental unit inSan Diegosaw its monthly rate plunge by 6%, to $2,667, after the number of permitted multifamily units in the city jumped by nearly 19% in 2024.\nBirmingham, AL, saw a similar trend, with the median rental price dropping by 5.4%, to $1,165, following a 22% upswing in construction permitting.\nAlthough Denver saw a sizable 41% decrease in multifamily construction last year, the city\u2019s median rent experienced the steepest annual drop of all the metros in February, shedding 6.4%, to arrive at $1,773.\nStudio rent prices generally tend to be volatile, but in February they matched one- and two-bedroom unit rent growth compared with the same period a year ago, at a level of just above -1%.\nA typical studio unit in February had a median rent of $1,413, down 0.8% year over year. Meanwhile, the median rent for a one-bedroom unit was $1,583, while a two-bedroom apartment could be rented for $1,887, with both of those figures representing a 0.7% annual decrease.\n\u201cThis is due to the market stabilizing in a pattern of consistent price retreat,\u201d explains Berner.\nA zoomed-out view reveals that studio units have had the smallest rent growth from five years ago, at 9.7%, as two-bedroom apartments have had the steepest uptick in rents, at 18.3%.\n\u201cStronger long-term rent growth for larger units could be attributed to the fact that fewer young renters are becoming first-time homebuyers amid high home prices and high mortgage rates, andfewer young people are forming independent householdslikely living with roommates instead, keeping demand for larger rentals elevated,\u201d says Berner.\nYear-over-year change (0-2 bedrooms): -6.4%Median monthly rent (0-2 bedrooms): $1,773\nYear-over-year change (0-2 bedrooms): -6%Median monthly rent (0-2 bedrooms): $2,667\nYear-over-year change (0-2 bedrooms): -5.4%Median monthly rent (0-2 bedrooms): $1,165\nYear-over-year change (0-2 bedrooms): -4.8%Median monthly rent (0-2 bedrooms): $1,462\nYear-over-year change (0-2 bedrooms): -3.6%Median monthly rent (0-2 bedrooms): $2,071\nYear-over-year change (0-2 bedrooms): -3.5%Median monthly rent (0-2 bedrooms): $1,458\nYear-over-year change (0-2 bedrooms): -3.3%Median monthly rent (0-2 bedrooms): $1,293\nYear-over-year change (0-2 bedrooms): -3.3%Median monthly rent (0-2 bedrooms): $2,678\nYear-over-year change (0-2 bedrooms): -3.1%Median monthly rent (0-2 bedrooms): $1,492\nYear-over-year change (0-2 bedrooms): -3.0%Median monthly rent (0-2 bedrooms): $1,170\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "What is \u2018vanlording\u2019 and how widespread is it?",
        "content": "San Jose, CA,\u00a0is cracking down on \u201cvanlords,\u201d whom city officials say are \u201cbad actors\u201d charging the homeless to live in dilapidated, nonworking vans.\n\u201cThis is a problem that flies under the radar, but my office has heard directly from residents about exploitative vanlords taking advantage of desperate renters searching for affordable housing,\u201d Councilmember\u00a0David Cohen\u00a0tells Realtor.com. \u201cThese rentals use city property to take advantage of vulnerable tenants without having to follow tenant protections for rental properties that protect the safety and financial well-being of lower income people.\u201d\nCohen\u2019s office sent Realtor.com photos of Facebook Marketplace listings showingRVs illegally for rent.\nOne had a monthly rent of $1,300 and another for $800.\nThe listings were active, and only a couple of many such listings. Some vanlords may charge even more.\n\u201cBy creating an ordinance to outlaw these rentals, we set an expectation of appropriate behavior,\u201d says Cohen. \u201cOur goal is to prevent this crisis from worsening, by shining some light on the situation before it becomes unmanageable.\u201d\nSaid Councilmember\u00a0Bien Doan\u00a0at a March 12 meeting addressing the issue: \u201cWe know there are bad actors out there that put dilapidated, nonworking van trailers or RVs out there, and then manipulate our unsheltered residents to rent these places inunsafe conditions, without any preparation for biohazard or hazardous waste or even a fire hazard.\u201d\nAccording to the\u00a0San Jose Spotlight, there are \u201ctwo known individuals\u201d who are renting out at least 20 motor homes to homeless people.\nIn 2023, police officers discovered one of these vanlords had purchased four to six RVs from a tow yard, set them up on Educational Park Drive and Las Plumas Avenue, and was charging people rent to live in them. According to the city, this activity is illegal.\nA September 2024\u00a0memofrom Chief of Police\u00a0Anthony Mata\u00a0sent to the City Council said that most of the RVs parked on the streets of San Jose did not belong to any of the houses nearby but were \u201cunregistered and unofficially owned by unhoused individuals who are using them as shelter.\u201d\nPolice said they had received hundreds of complaints about the vehicles, but that in general, it was not city policy to tow the vehicles if they were being used as shelter by individuals.\nPolice cited \u201cconcerns about individuals illegally placing RVs on public streets and renting those RVs to unhoused individuals.\u201d\nIt noted that the city of Los Angeles was taking action to curb \u201cvanlording activity\u201d by drafting an ordinance that would prohibit leasing and renting out RVs if they were parked on public streets.\nThe memo stressed that the police department was concerned about the vanlords, not the renters.\n\u201cThe focus of the issue is not the unhoused individuals living in the RVs, but rather the persons renting them and illegally placing them in public space to generate personal income,\u201d said the memo.\n\u201cThe City has an interest in enterprising individuals preying on the unhoused population of the city and capitalizing on their misfortunes by renting them RVs that have not passed safety inspections andlack basic plumbing and sewage removal.\u201d\nHowever, police say the vanlord issue doesn\u2019t seem to be widespread, and most people living in the RVs were not paying rent.\n\u201cThere does not appear to be a significant number of private individuals leasing or subleasing RVs to multiple people,\u201d said the memo.\nSan Francisco, Long Beach, San Diego, and Fresno have noted similar issues with RVs parked illegally on the streets. However, according to the same police memo, they are not taking action to prevent it at this time.\n\u201cStaff\u2019s research indicates that \u2018vanlording\u2019 is not currently a pervasive problem in San Jose,\u201d it said.\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped Doan and Councilmembers\u00a0Michael Mulcahy\u00a0and\u00a0David Cohen\u00a0from wanting to prevent the issue entirely.\nThe Rules Committee\u00a0recommended studying the problem and reporting back to the City Council in two weeks.\nMorning Report and Evening Update: Your source for today's top stories\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nBy clicking above you agree to theTerms of UseandPrivacy Policy.\nNever miss a story.\nAt least one RV resident,\u00a0Rudy Ortega, said he believes the crackdown is all about\u00a0Mayor Matt Mahan\u00a0wanting to sweep the streets of homeless people before an important event.\n\u201cHe wants to clear the streets of the homeless [before] the Super Bowl,\u201d he told the outlet. \u201cI think it\u2019s done purposely. It\u2019s another one of his tactics.\u201d\nSuper Bowl LX is scheduled to be held Feb. 8, 2026, in Santa Clara, which is a 15-minute drive from downtown San Jose.\nOrtega, who lives in an RV parked near Columbus Park and is apparently not renting, filed a restraining order against the city in 2022. However, a judged ruled he had to leave the area anyway.\nThe city has held a series of \u201csweeps\u201d meant to clear the streets of homeless encampments and illegally parked RVs, butmost homeless\u00a0simply return\u00a0to swept areasafter a certain amount of time.\nOrtega had a camper parked on the streets that reportedly was full of dead rodents.\nIt\u2019s unclear where exactly Ortega is living now, but he told the San Jose Spotlight that he knows of only one individual who is renting an RV. He points out that the real issue isn\u2019t the RVs but the unaffordability of housing.\nMeanwhile,Juanita Macias\u00a0told\u00a0ABC7that she once rented an RV for \u201c$500 every month\u201d and it didn\u2019t include electricity or water.\nMany of her \u201cneighbors are still renting RVs,\u201d she said, with landlords charging about \u201ca thousand, $800 sometimes.\u201d\nThe median home list price in San Jose is an eye-popping $1.4 million, well above the national median of\u00a0$400,500\u00a0as of February, according to\u00a0Realtor.com\u00ae. Renting is no better. The median rent is $3,180.\n\u201cBy restricting the sale, rental, or even transfer of RVs, you\u2019re targeting one of the last remaining options for shelter that unhoused individuals can afford,\u201d Ortega said at the recent City Council meeting.\n\u201cInstead of punishing those who seek shelter in RVs, the city should focus on providing real humane housing solutions.\u00a0If safety is the\u00a0concern, then provide sanitation services in designated areas with proper oversight, not further displacement.\u201d\nBut Cohen insisted that the issue isn\u2019t the homeless but the vanlords.\n\u201cOur concerns are for people who are putting out old, inoperable vehicles and then renting them to people to live in, as opposed to people who own their own RVs\u2014which is not at all the target of this potential ordinance,\u201d he said.\nRealtor.com reached out to Doan, Mahan, and local homeless nonprofit organizationHomeFirstfor comment.\nAdvertisement",

It entered contract on March 17.\nTim Schneider with The Cassina Group held the listing, but could not comment on the final sale price while the home sale remains pending.\n\u201cRenovation and interior design can be a daunting task \u2014 homes like this one that strike that balance between being ultra-specific versus needing everything sell very quickly,\u201d Schneider told The Post. \u201cA few potential buyers even asked if they would sell the home with the furniture and the gym equipment.\u201d\nLocated on Daniel Island, the home sports double front porches, brick steps and a crisp new exterior on a quiet street.\nInside, there are white oak floors, an airy open layout, a living room with a gas fireplace \u2014 and a chef\u2019s kitchen decked out with green cabinets, quartz counters and stainless steel appliances. The pad also features a den, a full bathroom, a screened porch with modern touches and a deck.\nUpstairs, the primary suite comes with its own porch, dual walk-in closets, a luxe tub and a big shower, plus two more bedrooms, another bathroom, laundry and attic space.\nA bonus room above the garage \u2014 complete with a kitchen, a bedroom, a living area, a bathroom and laundry hookups \u2014 serves as LeCroy\u2019s dressing room. The two-car garage, now with a slick epoxy floor, doubles as a personal gym.\nThe quick sale coincides with LeCroy\u2019s big news: she\u2019s expecting her second child, her first with husband Brett Randle, 38. The baby girl is due this summer.\n\u201cHonestly, we\u2019ve loved this house, but it\u2019s time for something that fits where we\u2019re headed next,\u201d she toldthe Daily Dish. \u201cLife\u2019s changing, our family\u2019s growing, and I\u2019ve got big dreams, so why not level up?\u201d\nLeCroy\u2019s already eyeing her next Charleston-area home with Randle.\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say \u2026 it\u2019s exactly what we need,\u201d she wrote in an email to the outlet. \u201cMore space, more charm and plenty of room for our family to grow.\u201d\nThe mom of 12-year-old Hudson says she\u2019s pumped to renovate again and plans to bring fans along for the ride.\n\u201cIt\u2019s got everything we\u2019ve wanted and then some, so get ready because y\u2019all know I\u2019ll be making it perfect!\u201d she said. \u201cAnd of course, I\u2019ll be sharing every step of the way, so stay tuned!\u201d\nThough Randle splits time between California and the East Coast for work, LeCroy\u2019s sticking close to home.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going far!\u201d she added. \u201cCharleston is home, and it\u2019s where we want to raise our children.

        "content": "Most people worry about their bike or car being stolen \u2014 not their home.\nBut that\u2019s exactly what happened to\u00a0D\u2019Andrea Turner\u00a0when\u00a0squatters\u00a0took over her\u00a0Phoenix\u00a0home and\u00a0sold\u00a0it without her knowledge.\n\u201cIt feels so surreal,\u201d Turnershared in an interview with\u00a0ABC 15 Arizona. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m in the Twilight Zone. Really, I didn\u2019t even think something like this could happen.\u201d\nBut it did. After Turner\u2019s ex-husband,\u00a0Keith \u2014 a long-haul trucker \u2014 left the house unattended for a period of time, two strangers,\u00a0Aaron Polmanteer\u00a0and\u00a0Lledera Hollen, forced their way in.\nOnce inside, they found personal documents belonging to the Turners, forged new ones, and assumed their identities.\n\u201cSquatters stole my house,\u201d Turner said, still in disbelief. \u201cThey actually moved in, posed as me, and sold my house.\u201d\nWith fraudulent paperwork in hand, Polmanteer and Hollen successfully listed and sold the home to real estate investors for $200,000 \u2014 all without the Turners knowing.\nThey might have gotten away with it too, but they ran into trouble when they tried to cash checks written out in the Turners\u2019 names.\nPolmanteer and Hollen now await trial, and Turner\u2019s home is back in the right hands. But the story highlights a growing trend of criminals selling property without the homeowners knowing about it. Here\u2019s how to guard yourself against this disturbing crime.\nYour keys give you physical access to your home, but yourtitlesecures your legal right to it. That right is recorded on adeed, the legal document that proves who holds ownership.\nIn a legitimate real estate transaction, the title transfer is carefully overseen by areal estate agent, title company, and notary to ensure everything is properly documented.\nBut fraudsters know how to manipulate the system, sometimes slipping through these safeguards undetected.\nJust ask Turner. By forging documents and impersonating her and her ex-husband, Polmanteer and Hollen were able to fool a title company and notary.\nBy the time Turner realized what had happened, the property had already changed hands on paper.\nWhen Turner saw the forged documents, she was stunned. \u201cThat is not my name, and that\u2019s not my signature,\u201d she said in an interview with ABC 15 Arizona. \u201cHow does this happen? At what point did someone not do their job?\u201d\nTitle fraudis on the rise and can happen to anyone, but properties that are vacant or mortgage-free are at the greatest risk.\nWithout proactive safeguards, homeowners may not discover their title has been stolen until long after its changed hands.\nMonitoring your property is essential to combat title theft. Many counties, including Maricopa County where Turner\u2019s home is located, offer free notifications whenever a document is recorded in your name.\nThis means if someonefraudulently files a deed transferon your property, you\u2019ll be notified immediately, giving you a chance to notify authorities.\nAnother way to catch fraud before it happens is to set up a simple Google alert for your address.\nBad actors sometimes list stolen properties for sale before homeowners even realize something is wrong. A Google alert will notify you any time your address is mentioned on the web.\nA title company\u2019s job is to ensure a property changes hands from seller to buyer without hidden issues like fraud.\nAs part of this process, they conduct thorough research into the property\u2019s history, checking for outstanding mortgages,liens, judgments, or unpaid taxes that could affect ownership.\nOnce they confirm a title is clear, the company compiles a title report and issues title insurance, which protects buyers from financial or legal trouble if hidden claims or fraud surface down the road\u2014like in the Turners\u2019 case.\nWhile fraud isn\u2019t always preventable,title insurancecan serve as a financial safety net, ensuring that homeowners and buyers aren\u2019t left paying for someone else\u2019s deception.\nMorning Report and Evening Update: Your source for today's top stories\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nBy clicking above you agree to theTerms of UseandPrivacy Policy.\nNever miss a story.\nThe fraudsters who stole the Turners\u2019 home were able to do so after accessing personal documents that helped them forge ownership records.\nWhether your home is occupied or vacant, taking simple precautions can help prevent this type of theft:\nIf you think someone has tampered with your home\u2019s title, act fast. The sooner you catch fraudulent activity, the better your chances are of reclaiming ownership.\nBy acting quickly and leveraging the right legal and investigative resources, you can work toward reclaiming your property.\nAdvertisement",

His industrious approach to art yielded more than 5,000 paintings, prints, drawings and other objects during his lifetime.\nThe space at 747 Washington St. even housed some of these highly valued works.\nThe 2,648-square-foot commercial structure is sandwiched between two Greenwich Village townhouses. To its left is Lichtenstein\u2019s former home and studio. That building now belongs to the Whitney Museum of American Art and currently hosts its Independent Study Program.\nVillage Preservation and the Whitneyadded a plaque to honor the siteat 741-745 Washington St. in 2023.\nNext door, 747 Washington St. is a rare find for the historic neighborhood. A coveted curb cut leads to a large garage with room for at least four cars.\nA winding wood and steel staircase leads up to an office space outfitted with custom built-in cabinetry, a kitchenette and a half bath.\nUpstairs, a glass wall overlooks a downtown gem \u2014 an additional 1,292-square-foot landscaped \u201cgreen roof\u201d and patio.

He was survived by his wife Dorothy, a celebrated philanthropist. Dorothy donated more than 1,000 of her husband\u2019s works to major museums before her death last July,according to her obituaryin the New York Times.\nDorothy\u2019s estate undertook the recent sale, represented by Lee Ann Jaffee and Steven Sumser at Compass.\nThe estate alsolisted the couple\u2019s longtime Southampton homelate last year for $20 million, which remains unsold.\nAdvertisement",

Over the next two decades, fourteen mill houses were lost to decay, the boarding house was demolished, and the abandoned site took on the appearance of a ghost town.\u201d\nThe official website notes that the main mill was believed to have burnt to the ground because of a lightening strike.\n\u201cHenry River is an example of history that seems so distant, yet it can still be seen, touched and heard with our own eyes and ears,\u201d the site reads.\nThe current owners, who are known only as Henry River Mill Village LLC, purchased the property in October 2017.\nAt the time of filming, there was a different owner.\nFans of the film franchise may be able to see the village on the big screen again soon asSuzanne Collins, author of \u201cThe Hunger Games,\u201d novels, revealed that the fifth installment,\u00a0\u201cSunrise on the Reaping,\u201d will hit shelves March 18.\nThe movie adaptation will debut in theaters in November 2026.\nAdvertisement",

More than 3.2 million people call the state home, according to an estimate by the U.S. Census Bureau.\nOhio is the second-most affordable state when it comes to getting a home, with Canton, Youngstown and\u00a0many other Ohio locales\u00a0seeing affordable prices, per Redfin. The real estate company pegged the state\u2019s median sale price at $231,400 and its median monthly housing payment at $1,472.\nRedfin said Oklahoma ranked No. 3, with homes there selling for a median $236,700.\nThe Mountain State boasts a median sale price of $243,100, according to the analysis. It derives its nickname from the well-known Appalachian Mountains that run through it.\nHouseholds in Michigan earn a median of $71,149, Redfin reported, citing the U.S. Census Bureau. Its No. 5 spot for buying a home is thanks to its $248,000 median sale price.\nMississippi, Missouri, Louisiana, Indiana and Arkansas were the five other states that Redfin ranked among the 10 cheapest when it came to homes.\nMeanwhile, with homes going for a median of $785,200, California earned 50th place on the ranking, meaning it was the priciest state, the analysis found.\nSome Americans have had difficulty purchasing homes in recent years amid the housing affordability crisis that the U.S. has been contending with.\nLast month, a survey released by Bankrate found 81% of Americans \u201cwho have owned a home in the past or never owned a home but want to some day\u201d called down payments and closing costs a \u201csignificant obstacle\u201d to getting a place.\nAbout 76% ofaspiring homeownersestimated the amount of time it will take them to sock away sufficient funds for a house down payment at one year or more, according to Bankrate.\nMany U.S. adults \u2014 75% \u2014 still consider homeownership to be a component of the American Dream, Realtor.com found in a separate January survey.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "Thursday marks the first day of spring, which means one thing \u2014 selling season.\nSoon house hunters will emerge from their hibernation to snap up the best properties. Recent data fromRealtor.com revealedfive red-hot US metros where single-family homes are selling the fastest, and they\u2019re all coastal hubs.\u00a0Despite rapid-fire sales, however, median listing prices declined across the board.\nHomes in San Jose, California topped the list with a median shelf life of just 22 days on the market. That\u2019s well below the nationwide median of 66 days. The San Jose market is highly competitive and consistently ranks among the nation\u2019s most expensive. Single-family homes in the Silicon Valley city clocked in at a median price of $1.3 million in February.\nJust an hour\u2019s drive away is the country\u2019s second hottest market \u2014 San Francisco. Home prices in the notoriously pricey city by the bay hit a median cost of nearly $900,000 in February. The typical San Fran home only stayed on the market for 30 days last month.\nAcross the country, the third fastest-moving market was Boston, where homes lingered for as little as 33 days. Beantown sold big in February, with a median asking price of $839,450.\nBesides Boston, Washington, DC is the only other metro outside of California that made the list. Properties in the nation\u2019s capital tied with San Diego for a median of 34 days on the market.\nHomes in sunny San Diego listed for a median of nearly $950,000. Properties in DC listed for around $580,000 last month, but tides may be turning for that market. All eyes remain onthe ongoing real estate impactsof mass federal worker layoffs.\nThis recent data comes from Realtor.com\u2019smonthly report on housing market trends. Despite the high demand seen in metros like San Jose and Boston, monthly data over the past year has broadly revealed a shift towards a buyer\u2019s market.\nPrices have slowed even in the top five fastest-selling metros. According to Realtor.com data, every single one of these cities saw year-over-year median listing price declines, ranging from a 9% drop in San Francisco to 1.8% dip in Boston.\nThe total number of for-sale nationwide homes is nearly 30% higher than last year, according to the February\u2019s report, and the total number of unsold homes increased in the same period by almost 20%.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "A crumbling Chicago masterpiece designed by the legendary architect Frank Lloyd Wright has landed on a watchlist of at-risk buildings in the Windy City \u2014 and preservationists are sounding the alarm.\nThe J.J. Walser Jr. House, a rare Prairie-style relic nestled in the Austin neighborhood, is one of just five surviving Wright designs of its kind in Chicago \u2014 and it\u2019s teetering on the edge of collapse after years of neglect.\nEvery spring, the folks at Preservation Chicago drop theirChicago 7 list, spotlighting the city\u2019s most endangered architectural treasures, which includes this very property.\n\u201cThe Walser House had been on our watchlist of buildings for several years,\u201d Ward Miller, the group\u2019s executive director, toldArtnet News.\n\u201cThe vacancy of the building, along with the visual inspection of the building\u2019s interior and noting both the water damage and vandalism, lead us to make this a priority and emergency advocacy effort.\u201d\nThis architectural stunner was whipped up in 1903 for printing bigwig Joseph Jacob Walser, with Wright keeping costs low at $4,000 \u2014 about $150,000 in today\u2019s figures.\nIts design includes wide eaves, a breezy layout, custom furniture and dazzling art glass windows. But now, the place is deteriorating. The last owners, Anne and Hurley Teague, scooped it up in 1970.\nHurley, a contractor, worked diligently to keep it standing until he passed away 1997. Anne followed in 2019, and since then, the house has been left to rot, battered by Chicago\u2019s notoriously brutal weather.\n\u201cThe house has been unoccupied and unmaintained for the past six years,\u201d thePreservation Chicago\u2019s websitesays.\nEven with some patchwork fixes and brush-clearing by do-gooders, the whole property is screaming for a top-to-bottom overhaul.\n\u201cEvery part of this house needs attention,\u201d\u00a0TheFrank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancyadded on its website, asking for someone to swoop in, shore it up and bring it back to life.\nDesignated a Chicago Landmark in 1981 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2013, the house can\u2019t be torn down \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s safe from falling apart.\nA reverse mortgage from 2003 and ongoing foreclosure fights are gumming up the works, according to theAustin Weekly News.\n\u201cThis needs to occur quickly,\u201d Miller told Artnet. \u201cThe home is very susceptible to environmental conditions and also to people breaking and entering onto the property.\u201d\nWith advocacy crews like Preservation Chicago and the Conservancy keeping tabs, they\u2019re pushing hard to speed up the legal mess.\nA new owner could tap into federal and state tax breaks to fund the fix-up, but the clock\u2019s ticking.\n\u201cIts longtime owners tried their very best to maintain the home, despite the costs associated with some of the various needs and requirements, as they continued to age,\u201d Miller toldArchitectural Digest.\n\u201cWe need the community to voice their support for this amazing house and be a partner in its restoration, repair and revival.\u201d\nHe\u2019s also pleading with City Hall to help fund the resurrection of Wright\u2019s vision before it\u2019s too late.\nAdvertisement",
